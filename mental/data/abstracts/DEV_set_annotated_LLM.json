    "abstract": "We propose a definition of persistent Stiefel-Whitney classes of vector bundle filtrations. It relies on seeing vector bundles as subsets of some Euclidean spaces. The usual Čech filtration of such a subset can be endowed with a vector bundle structure, that we call a Čech bundle filtration. We show that this construction is stable and consistent. When the dataset is a finite sample of a line bundle, we implement an effective algorithm to compute its persistent Stiefel-Whitney classes. In order to use simplicial approximation techniques in practice, we develop a notion of weak simplicial approximation. As a theoretical example, we give an in-depth study of the normal bundle of the circle, which reduces to understanding the persistent cohomology of the torus knot (1,2). We illustrate our method on several datasets inspired by image analysis.",

    "abstract": "A computational fluid dynamics code is differentiated using algorithmic differentiation (AD) in both tangent and adjoint modes. The two novelties of the present approach are 1) the adjoint code is obtained by letting the AD tool Tapenade invert the complete layer of message passing interface (MPI) communications, and 2) the adjoint code integrates time-dependent, non-linear and dissipative (hence physically irreversible) PDEs with an explicit time integration loop running for ca. $10^{6}$ time steps. The approach relies on using the Adjoinable MPI library to reverse the non-blocking communication patterns in the original code, and by controlling the memory overhead induced by the time-stepping loop with binomial checkpointing. A description of the necessary code modifications is provided along with the validation of the computed derivatives and a performance comparison of the tangent and adjoint codes.",

While most opportunities taken up by the VIS community will likely focus on the psychology of users, there are also opportunities for studying the psychology of designers. In this position paper, I argue the importance of studying design cognition as a necessary component of a holistic program of research on visualization psychology. I provide a brief overview of research on design cognition in other disciplines, and discuss opportunities for VIS to build an analogous research program. Doing so can lead to a stronger integration of research and design practice, can provide a better understanding of how to educate and train future designers, and will likely surface both challenges and opportunities for future research.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved unprecedented performance on a wide range of complex tasks, rapidly outpacing our understanding of the nature of their solutions. This has caused a recent surge of interest in methods for rendering modern neural systems more interpretable. In this work, we propose to address the interpretability problem in modern DNNs using the rich history of problem descriptions, theories and experimental methods developed by cognitive psychologists to study the human mind. To explore the potential value of these tools, we chose a well-established analysis from developmental psychology that explains how children learn word labels for objects, and applied that analysis to DNNs. Using datasets of stimuli inspired by the original cognitive psychology experiments, we find that state-of-the-art one shot learning models trained on ImageNet exhibit a similar bias to that observed in humans: they prefer to categorize objects according to shape rather than color. The magnitude of this shape bias varies greatly among architecturally identical, but differently seeded models, and even fluctuates within seeds throughout training, despite nearly equivalent classification performance. These results demonstrate the capability of tools from cognitive psychology for exposing hidden computational properties of DNNs, while concurrently providing us with a computational model for human word learning.",

    "title": "Can generative AI and ChatGPT outperform humans on cognitive-demanding problem-solving tasks in science?",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine an assumption that generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools can overcome the cognitive intensity that humans suffer when solving problems. We compared the performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on 2019 NAEP science assessments with students by cognitive demands of the items. Fifty-four tasks were coded by experts using a two-dimensional cognitive load framework, including task cognitive complexity and dimensionality. ChatGPT and GPT-4 responses were scored using the scoring keys of NAEP. The analysis of the available data was based on the average student ability scores for students who answered each item correctly and the percentage of students who responded to individual items. Results showed that both ChatGPT and GPT-4 consistently outperformed most students who answered the NAEP science assessments. As the cognitive demand for NAEP tasks increases, statistically higher average student ability scores are required to correctly address the questions. This pattern was observed for students in grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. However, ChatGPT and GPT-4 were not statistically sensitive to the increase in cognitive demands of the tasks, except for Grade 4. As the first study focusing on comparing GAI and K-12 students in problem-solving in science, this finding implies the need for changes to educational objectives to prepare students with competence to work with GAI tools in the future. Education ought to emphasize the cultivation of advanced cognitive skills rather than depending solely on tasks that demand cognitive intensity. This approach would foster critical thinking, analytical skills, and the application of knowledge in novel contexts. Findings also suggest the need for innovative assessment practices by moving away from cognitive intensity tasks toward creativity and analytical skills to avoid the negative effects of GAI on testing more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Background: Exploration of the physical environment is an indispensable precursor to information acquisition and knowledge consolidation for living organisms. Yet, current artificial intelligence models lack these autonomy capabilities during training, hindering their adaptability. This work proposes a learning framework for artificial agents to obtain an intrinsic exploratory drive, based on epistemic and achievement emotions triggered during data observation. Methods: This study proposes a dual-module reinforcement framework, where data analysis scores dictate pride or surprise, in accordance with psychological studies on humans. A correlation between these states and exploration is then optimized for agents to meet their learning goals. Results: Causal relationships between states and exploration are demonstrated by the majority of agents. A 15.4\\% mean increase is noted for surprise, with a 2.8\\% mean decrease for pride. Resulting correlations of $ρ_{surprise}=0.461$ and $ρ_{pride}=-0.237$ are obtained, mirroring previously reported human behavior. Conclusions: These findings lead to the conclusion that bio-inspiration for AI development can be of great use. This can incur benefits typically found in living beings, such as autonomy. Further, it empirically shows how AI methodologies can corroborate human behavioral findings, showcasing major interdisciplinary importance. Ramifications are discussed.",

In order to explore this question, we propose an approach called hyperparameter hypothesization that uses predictive hyperparameter tuning in order to find individuating descriptors of cognitive-behavioral profiles. We take the first step in this approach by predicting human performance in the semantic fluency task (SFT), a well-studied task in cognitive science that has never before been modeled using transformer-based language models (TLMs). In our task setup, we compare several approaches to predicting which word an individual performing SFT will utter next. We report preliminary evidence suggesting that, despite obvious implementational differences in how people and TLMs learn and use language, TLMs can be used to identify individual differences in human fluency task behaviors better than existing computational models, and may offer insights into human memory retrieval strategies -- cognitive process not typically considered to be the kinds of things TLMs can model. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for cognitive modeling of knowledge representations.",

    "abstract": "Mollusk shells are an ideal model system for understanding the morpho-elastic basis of morphological evolution of invertebrates' exoskeletons. During the formation of the shell, the mantle tissue secretes proteins and minerals that calcify to form a new incremental layer of the exoskeleton. Most of the existing literature on the morphology of mollusks is descriptive. The mathematical understanding of the underlying coupling between pre-existing shell morphology, de novo surface deposition and morpho-elastic volume growth is at a nascent stage, primarily limited to reduced geometric representations. Here, we propose a general, three-dimensional computational framework coupling pre-existing morphology, incremental surface growth by accretion, and morpho-elastic volume growth. We exercise this framework by applying it to explain the stepwise morphogenesis of seashells during growth: new material surfaces are laid down by accretive growth on the mantle whose form is determined by its morpho-elastic growth. Calcification of the newest surfaces extends the shell as well as creates a new scaffold that constrains the next growth step. We study the effects of surface and volumetric growth rates, and of previously deposited shell geometries on the resulting modes of mantle deformation, and therefore of the developing shell's morphology. Connections are made to a range of complex shells ornamentations.",

This success is due in part to the ability of DNNs to learn useful representations of high-dimensional inputs, a problem that humans must also solve. We examine the relationship between the representations learned by these networks and human psychological representations recovered from similarity judgments. We find that deep features learned in service of object classification account for a significant amount of the variance in human similarity judgments for a set of animal images. However, these features do not capture some qualitative distinctions that are a key part of human representations. To remedy this, we develop a method for adapting deep features to align with human similarity judgments, resulting in image representations that can potentially be used to extend the scope of psychological experiments.",

Temporal information is required for higher-level cognitive abilities such as planning, decision making, communication, and effective cooperation. Since time is an inseparable part of cognition, there is a growing interest in the artificial intelligence approach to subjective time, which has a possibility of advancing the field. The current survey study aims to provide researchers with an interdisciplinary perspective on time perception. Firstly, we introduce a brief background from the psychology and neuroscience literature, covering the characteristics and models of time perception and related abilities. Secondly, we summarize the emergent computational and robotic models of time perception. A general overview to the literature reveals that a substantial amount of timing models are based on a dedicated time processing like the emergence of a clock-like mechanism from the neural network dynamics and reveal a relationship between the embodiment and time perception. We also notice that most models of timing are developed for either sensory timing (i.e. ability to assess an interval) or motor timing (i.e. ability to reproduce an interval). The number of timing models capable of retrospective timing, which is the ability to track time without paying attention, is insufficient. In this light, we discuss the possible research directions to promote interdisciplinary collaboration in the field of time perception.",

    "abstract": "Automatically generating short summaries from users' online mental health posts could save counselors' reading time and reduce their fatigue so that they can provide timely responses to those seeking help for improving their mental state. Recent Transformers-based summarization models have presented a promising approach to abstractive summarization. They go beyond sentence selection and extractive strategies to deal with more complicated tasks such as novel word generation and sentence paraphrasing. Nonetheless, these models have a prominent shortcoming; their training strategy is not quite efficient, which restricts the model's performance. In this paper, we include a curriculum learning approach to reweigh the training samples, bringing about an efficient learning procedure. We apply our model on extreme summarization dataset of MentSum posts -- a dataset of mental health related posts from Reddit social media. Compared to the state-of-the-art model, our proposed method makes substantial gains in terms of Rouge and Bertscore evaluation metrics, yielding 3.5% (Rouge-1), 10.4% (Rouge-2), and 4.7% (Rouge-L), 1.5% (Bertscore) relative improvements.",

    "title": "Meta Transfer Learning for Emotion Recognition",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely adopted in automatic emotion recognition and has lead to significant progress in the field. However, due to insufficient annotated emotion datasets, pre-trained models are limited in their generalization capability and thus lead to poor performance on novel test sets. To mitigate this challenge, transfer learning performing fine-tuning on pre-trained models has been applied. However, the fine-tuned knowledge may overwrite and/or discard important knowledge learned from pre-trained models. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a PathNet-based transfer learning method that is able to transfer emotional knowledge learned from one visual/audio emotion domain to another visual/audio emotion domain, and transfer the emotional knowledge learned from multiple audio emotion domains into one another to improve overall emotion recognition accuracy. To show the robustness of our proposed system, various sets of experiments for facial expression recognition and speech emotion recognition task on three emotion datasets: SAVEE, EMODB, and eNTERFACE have been carried out. The experimental results indicate that our proposed system is capable of improving the performance of emotion recognition, making its performance substantially superior to the recent proposed fine-tuning/pre-trained models based transfer learning methods.",

    "title": "Beyond DAGs: Modeling Causal Feedback with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps",
    "abstract": "Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) model feedback causal relations in interwoven webs of causality and policy variables. FCMs are fuzzy signed directed graphs that allow degrees of causal influence and event occurrence. Such causal models can simulate a wide range of policy scenarios and decision processes. Their directed loops or cycles directly model causal feedback. Their nonlinear dynamics permit forward-chaining inference from input causes and policy options to output effects. Users can add detailed dynamics and feedback links directly to the causal model or infer them with statistical learning laws. Users can fuse or combine FCMs from multiple experts by weighting and adding the underlying fuzzy edge matrices and do so recursively if needed. The combined FCM tends to better represent domain knowledge as the expert sample size increases if the expert sample approximates a random sample. Many causal models use more restrictive directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and Bayesian probabilities. DAGs do not model causal feedback because they do not contain closed loops. Combining DAGs also tends to produce cycles and thus tends not to produce a new DAG. Combining DAGs tends to produce a FCM. FCM causal influence is also transitive whereas probabilistic causal influence is not transitive in general. Overall: FCMs trade the numerical precision of probabilistic DAGs for pattern prediction, faster and scalable computation, ease of combination, and richer feedback representation. We show how FCMs can apply to problems of public support for insurgency and terrorism and to US-China conflict relations in Graham Allison's Thucydides-trap framework. The appendix gives the textual justification of the Thucydides-trap FCM. It also extends our earlier theorem [Osoba-Kosko2017] to a more general result that shows the transitive and total causal influence that upstream concept nodes exert on downstream nodes.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging the synergy between causal knowledge graphs and a large language model (LLM), our study introduces a groundbreaking approach for computational hypothesis generation in psychology. We analyzed 43,312 psychology articles using a LLM to extract causal relation pairs. This analysis produced a specialized causal graph for psychology. Applying link prediction algorithms, we generated 130 potential psychological hypotheses focusing on `well-being', then compared them against research ideas conceived by doctoral scholars and those produced solely by the LLM. Interestingly, our combined approach of a LLM and causal graphs mirrored the expert-level insights in terms of novelty, clearly surpassing the LLM-only hypotheses (t(59) = 3.34, p=0.007 and t(59) = 4.32, p<0.001, respectively). This alignment was further corroborated using deep semantic analysis. Our results show that combining LLM with machine learning techniques such as causal knowledge graphs can revolutionize automated discovery in psychology, extracting novel insights from the extensive literature. This work stands at the crossroads of psychology and artificial intelligence, championing a new enriched paradigm for data-driven hypothesis generation in psychological research.",

The future belongs to those who can best collaborate with artificial cognitive entities achieving a high degree of cognitive augmenta-tion. However, we currently lack theoretically grounded fundamental metrics able to describe human or artificial cognition much less augmented and combined cognition. How do we measure thinking, cognition, information, and knowledge in an implementation-independent way? How can we tell how much thinking an artificial entity does and how much is done by a human? How can we measure the combined and possible even emergent effect of humans working together with intelligent artificial entities? These are some of the challenges for research-ers in this field. We first define a cognitive process as the transformation of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. We then review several existing and emerging information metrics based on entropy, processing effort, quantum physics, emergent capacity, and human concept learning. We then discuss how these fail to answer the above questions and provide guidelines for future re-search.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) has the unique potential to offer access to medical imaging to anyone, everywhere. Devices have become ultra-portable and cost-effective, akin to the stethoscope. Nevertheless US image quality and diagnostic efficacy are still highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-image patients, image quality is often insufficient for reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we put forth that US imaging systems can be recast as information-seeking agents that engage in reciprocal interactions with their anatomical environment. Such agents autonomously adapt their transmit-receive sequences to fully personalize imaging and actively maximize information gain in-situ. To that end, we will show that the sequence of pulse-echo experiments that a US system performs can be interpreted as a perception-action loop: the action is the data acquisition, probing tissue with acoustic waves and recording reflections at the detection array, and perception is the inference of the anatomical and or functional state, potentially including associated diagnostic quantities. We then equip systems with a mechanism to actively reduce uncertainty and maximize diagnostic value across a sequence of experiments, treating action and perception jointly using Bayesian inference given generative models of the environment and action-conditional pulse-echo observations. Since the representation capacity of the generative models dictates both the quality of inferred anatomical states and the effectiveness of inferred sequences of future imaging actions, we will be greatly leveraging the enormous advances in deep generative modelling that are currently disrupting many fields and society at large. Finally, we show some examples of cognitive, closed-loop, US systems that perform active beamsteering and adaptive scanline selection, based on deep generative models that track anatomical belief states.",

    "abstract": "The present communication addresses a set of observations, obeying both deterministic as well as statistical formal requirements, and serving to operate within the framework of the dynamical systems theory, with a certain emphasis placed on initial data. It is argued that statistical approaches can manifest themselves non unequivocally, leading to certain virtual discrepancies in psychological and/or cognitive data analyses, termed sometimes in literature as, questionable research practices. This communication points to the demand for a deep awareness of the data origins, which can indicate whether the exponential (Malthus type) or the algebraic (Pareto type) statistical distribution ought to be effectively considered in practical interpretation. This is also related to the question of how frequently patients behave in a specific way, and the significance of these behaviors in determining a patient's progression or regression, involving a certain memory effect. In this perspective, it is discussed how a sensitively applied hazardous or triggering factor can be helpful for well-controlled psychological strategic treatments, also those attributable to obsessive/compulsive disorders or even self-injurious behaviors, with their both criticality and complexity exploiting relations between a therapist and a patient.",

    "abstract": "Addressing the critical shortage of mental health resources for effective screening, diagnosis, and treatment remains a significant challenge. This scarcity underscores the need for innovative solutions, particularly in enhancing the accessibility and efficacy of therapeutic support. Embodied agents with advanced interactive capabilities emerge as a promising and cost-effective supplement to traditional caregiving methods. Crucial to these agents' effectiveness is their ability to simulate non-verbal behaviors, like backchannels, that are pivotal in establishing rapport and understanding in therapeutic contexts but remain under-explored. To improve the rapport-building capabilities of embodied agents we annotated backchannel smiles in videos of intimate face-to-face conversations over topics such as mental health, illness, and relationships. We hypothesized that both speaker and listener behaviors affect the duration and intensity of backchannel smiles. Using cues from speech prosody and language along with the demographics of the speaker and listener, we found them to contain significant predictors of the intensity of backchannel smiles. Based on our findings, we introduce backchannel smile production in embodied agents as a generation problem. Our attention-based generative model suggests that listener information offers performance improvements over the baseline speaker-centric generation approach. Conditioned generation using the significant predictors of smile intensity provides statistically significant improvements in empirical measures of generation quality. Our user study by transferring generated smiles to an embodied agent suggests that agent with backchannel smiles is perceived to be more human-like and is an attractive alternative for non-personal conversations over agent without backchannel smiles.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we develop a pipeline for historical-psychological text analysis in classical Chinese. Humans have produced texts in various languages for thousands of years; however, most of the computational literature is focused on contemporary languages and corpora. The emerging field of historical psychology relies on computational techniques to extract aspects of psychology from historical corpora using new methods developed in natural language processing (NLP). The present pipeline, called Contextualized Construct Representations (CCR), combines expert knowledge in psychometrics (i.e., psychological surveys) with text representations generated via transformer-based language models to measure psychological constructs such as traditionalism, norm strength, and collectivism in classical Chinese corpora. Considering the scarcity of available data, we propose an indirect supervised contrastive learning approach and build the first Chinese historical psychology corpus (C-HI-PSY) to fine-tune pre-trained models. We evaluate the pipeline to demonstrate its superior performance compared with other approaches. The CCR method outperforms word-embedding-based approaches across all of our tasks and exceeds prompting with GPT-4 in most tasks. Finally, we benchmark the pipeline against objective, external data to further verify its validity.",

    "abstract": "Human drivers have limited and time-varying cognitive resources when making decisions in real-world traffic scenarios, which often leads to unique and stochastic behaviors that can not be explained by perfect rationality assumption, a widely accepted premise in modeling driving behaviors that presume drivers rationally make decisions to maximize their own rewards under all circumstances. To explicitly address this disadvantage, this study presents a novel driver behavior model that aims to capture the resource rationality and stochasticity of the human driver's behaviors in realistic longitudinal driving scenarios. The resource rationality principle can provide a theoretic framework to better understand the human cognition processes by modeling human's internal cognitive mechanisms as utility maximization subject to cognitive resource limitations, which can be represented as finite and time-varying preview horizons in the context of driving. An inverse resource rational-based stochastic inverse reinforcement learning approach (IRR-SIRL) is proposed to learn a distribution of the planning horizon and cost function of the human driver with a given series of human demonstrations. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with a time-varying horizon approach is used to generate driver-specific trajectories by using the learned distributions of the planning horizon and the cost function of the driver. The simulation experiments are carried out using human demonstrations gathered from the driver-in-the-loop driving simulator. The results reveal that the proposed inverse resource rational-based stochastic driver model can address the resource rationality and stochasticity of human driving behaviors in a variety of realistic longitudinal driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Researchers continue to be interested in exploring the effects that covariates have on the heterogeneity in trajectories. The inclusion of covariates associated with latent classes allows for a more clear understanding of individual differences and a more meaningful interpretation of latent class membership. Many theoretical and empirical studies have focused on investigating heterogeneity in change patterns of a univariate repeated outcome and examining the effects on baseline covariates that inform the cluster formation. However, developmental processes rarely unfold in isolation; therefore, empirical researchers often desire to examine two or more outcomes over time, hoping to understand their joint development where these outcomes and their change patterns are correlated. This study examines the heterogeneity in parallel nonlinear trajectories and identifies baseline characteristics as predictors of latent classes. Our simulation studies show that the proposed model can tell the clusters of parallel trajectories apart and provide unbiased and accurate point estimates with target coverage probabilities for the parameters of interest in general. We illustrate how to apply the model to investigate the heterogeneity in the joint development of reading and mathematics ability from Grade K to 5. In this real-world example, we also demonstrate how to select covariates that contribute the most to the latent classes and transform candidate covariates from a large set into a more manageable set with retaining the meaningful properties of the original set in the structural equation modeling framework.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's lives around the world on an unprecedented scale. We intend to investigate hoarding behaviors in response to the pandemic using large-scale social media data. First, we collect hoarding-related tweets shortly after the outbreak of the coronavirus. Next, we analyze the hoarding and anti-hoarding patterns of over 42,000 unique Twitter users in the United States from March 1 to April 30, 2020, and dissect the hoarding-related tweets by age, gender, and geographic location. We find the percentage of females in both hoarding and anti-hoarding groups is higher than that of the general Twitter user population. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we investigate the opinions expressed towards the hoarding behavior by categorizing these topics according to demographic and geographic groups. We also calculate the anxiety scores for the hoarding and anti-hoarding related tweets using a lexical approach. By comparing their anxiety scores with the baseline Twitter anxiety score, we reveal further insights. The LIWC anxiety mean for the hoarding-related tweets is significantly higher than the baseline Twitter anxiety mean. Interestingly, beer has the highest calculated anxiety score compared to other hoarded items mentioned in the tweets.",

Drawing from concepts such as path-dependency, first-order autocorrelation, state-dependency, and hysteresis, the present study is an attempt to address how earlier responses serve as an anchor for subsequent answers in tests, surveys, and questionnaires. Introducing the notion of non-commuting observables derived from quantum physics, I highlight their role in characterizing psychological processes and the impact of measurement instruments on participants' responses. We advocate for the utilization of first-order Markov chain modeling to capture and forecast sequential dependencies in survey and test responses. The employment of the first-order Markov chain model lies in individuals' propensity to exhibit partial focus to preceding responses, with recent items most likely exerting a substantial influence on subsequent response selection. This study contributes to advancing our understanding of the dynamics inherent in sequential data within psychological research and provides a methodological framework for conducting longitudinal analyses of response patterns of test and questionnaire.",

Our paper focuses on the available methods of sensing mental health problems through direct and indirect measures. We see how active and passive sensing by technologies as well as reporting from relevant sources can contribute toward these detection methods.

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition is involved in several real-world applications. With an increase in available modalities, automatic understanding of emotions is being performed more accurately. The success in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER), primarily relies on the supervised learning paradigm. However, data annotation is expensive, time-consuming, and as emotion expression and perception depends on several factors (e.g., age, gender, culture) obtaining labels with a high reliability is hard. Motivated by these, we focus on unsupervised feature learning for MER. We consider discrete emotions, and as modalities text, audio and vision are used. Our method, as being based on contrastive loss between pairwise modalities, is the first attempt in MER literature. Our end-to-end feature learning approach has several differences (and advantages) compared to existing MER methods: i) it is unsupervised, so the learning is lack of data labelling cost; ii) it does not require data spatial augmentation, modality alignment, large number of batch size or epochs; iii) it applies data fusion only at inference; and iv) it does not require backbones pre-trained on emotion recognition task. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms several baseline approaches and unsupervised learning methods applied in MER. Particularly, it even surpasses a few supervised MER state-of-the-art.",

In addition to using a cognitive modeling as a means to explore how antiblackness may manifest in the design and development of AI systems (particularly from a software engineering perspective), we also introduce connections between antiblackness, the Human, and computational cognitive modeling.

    "abstract": "Memory behavior modeling is a core issue in cognitive psychology and education. Classical psychological theories typically use memory equations to describe memory behavior, which exhibits insufficient accuracy and controversy, while data-driven memory modeling methods often require large amounts of training data and lack interpretability. Knowledge-informed neural network models have shown excellent performance in fields like physics, but there have been few attempts in the domain of behavior modeling. This paper proposed a psychology theory informed neural networks for memory behavior modeling named PsyINN, where it constructs a framework that combines neural network with differentiating sparse regression, achieving joint optimization. Specifically, to address the controversies and ambiguity of descriptors in memory equations, a descriptor evolution method based on differentiating operators is proposed to achieve precise characterization of descriptors and the evolution of memory theoretical equations. Additionally, a buffering mechanism for the sparse regression and a multi-module alternating iterative optimization method are proposed, effectively mitigating gradient instability and local optima issues. On four large-scale real-world memory behavior datasets, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy. Ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed refinements, and application experiments showcase its potential in inspiring psychological research.",

These psychological factors are important as lack of attention to these can lead to detrimental outcome of disaster management effort. Disaster psychology has been seen as an emerging area of research and practice which deals with understanding of the psychological impact of individuals and community aftermath of the disasters. The aim of this paper is to put forward the conceptualization and development of dynamic networked psychology as a theoretical framework and its implications in exploring emotional contagion during disasters. We advocate theories of structural network dynamics can be used to construct DNP for exploring individuals as well as community coping mechanisms for improving preparedness, response and recovery of disasters. The advent of computational social science promotes the empirical modelling and analysis of massive volume of user data by inferring meaningful patterns for finding answers to important social and behavioral science research questions dealing with individual and community coping ability. In presenting a theoretical framework, we suggest that the underlying assumptions and integration of theories of social influence can be used to explore networks of emotional contagion for disasters.",

Using a self-developed tiered coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy, generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with.

    "abstract": "Empirical researchers are usually interested in investigating the impacts of baseline covariates have when uncovering sample heterogeneity and separating samples into more homogeneous groups. However, a considerable number of studies in the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework usually start with vague hypotheses in terms of heterogeneity and possible reasons. It suggests that (1) the determination and specification of a proper model with covariates is not straightforward, and (2) the exploration process may be computational intensive given that a model in the SEM framework is usually complicated and the pool of candidate covariates is usually huge in the psychological and educational domain where the SEM framework is widely employed. Following Bakk and Kuha (2017), this article presents a two-step growth mixture model (GMM) that examines the relationship between latent classes of nonlinear trajectories and baseline characteristics. Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of clustering the nonlinear change patterns, and estimating the parameters of interest unbiasedly, precisely, as well as exhibiting appropriate confidence interval coverage. Considering the pool of candidate covariates is usually huge and highly correlated, this study also proposes implementing exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to reduce the dimension of covariate space. We illustrate how to use the hybrid method, the two-step GMM and EFA, to efficiently explore the heterogeneity of nonlinear trajectories of longitudinal mathematics achievement data.",

    "abstract": "Influence among individuals is at the core of collective social phenomena such as the dissemination of ideas, beliefs or behaviors, social learning and the diffusion of innovations. Different mechanisms have been proposed to implement inter-agent influence in social models from the voter model, to majority rules, to the Granoveter model. Here we advance in this direction by confronting the recently introduced Social Influence and Recurrent Mobility (SIRM) model, that reproduces generic features of vote-shares at different geographical levels, with data in the US presidential elections. Our approach incorporates spatial and population diversity as inputs for the opinion dynamics while individuals' mobility provides a proxy for social context, and peer imitation accounts for social influence. The model captures the observed stationary background fluctuations in the vote-shares across counties. We study the so-called political strongholds, i.e., locations where the votes-shares for a party are systematically higher than average. A quantitative definition of a stronghold by means of persistence in time of fluctuations in the voting spatial distribution is introduced, and results from the US Presidential Elections during the period 1980-2012 are analyzed within this framework. We compare electoral results with simulations obtained with the SIRM model finding a good agreement both in terms of the number and the location of strongholds. The strongholds duration is also systematically characterized in the SIRM model. The results compare well with the electoral results data revealing an exponential decay in the persistence of the strongholds with time.",

Somatosensory cognition is the basis of our ability to act upon and to transform the physical world around us, to recognize objects on the basis of touch alone, and to grasp them with the right amount of force for lifting and manipulating them. Recent technology has permitted the wireless monitoring of grip force signals recorded from biosensors in the palm of the human hand to track and trace human grip forces deployed in cognitive tasks executed under conditions of variable sensory (visual, auditory) input. Non-invasive multi-finger grip force sensor technology can be exploited to explore functional interactions between somatosensory brain mechanisms and motor control, in particular during learning a novel and complex tasks where the planning and strategic execution of hand movements is essential. Under the light of a comprehensive overview of recent discoveries into the functional significance of human grip force variations, perspectives for future studies in cognition, in particular the cognitive control of strategic hand movements in robot-assisted precision tasks, are pointed out.",

    "abstract": "Rapid individual cognitive phenotyping holds the potential to revolutionize domains as wide-ranging as personalized learning, employment practices, and precision psychiatry. Going beyond limitations imposed by traditional lab-based experiments, new efforts have been underway towards greater ecological validity and participant diversity to capture the full range of individual differences in cognitive abilities and behaviors across the general population. Building on this, we developed Skill Lab, a novel game-based tool that simultaneously assesses a broad suite of cognitive abilities while providing an engaging narrative. Skill Lab consists of six mini-games as well as 14 established cognitive ability tasks. Using a popular citizen science platform (N = 10725), we conducted a comprehensive validation in the wild of a game-based cognitive assessment suite. Based on the game and validation task data, we constructed reliable models to simultaneously predict eight cognitive abilities based on the users' in-game behavior. Follow-'-up validation tests revealed that the models can discriminate nuances contained within each separate cognitive ability as well as capture a shared main factor of generalized cognitive ability. Our game-based measures are five times faster to complete than the equivalent task-based measures and replicate previous findings on the decline of certain cognitive abilities with age in our large cross-sectional population sample (N = 6369). Taken together, our results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid in-the-wild systematic assessment of cognitive abilities as a promising first step towards population-scale benchmarking and individualized mental health diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "AI-augmented systems are traditionally designed to streamline human decision-making by minimizing cognitive load, clarifying arguments, and optimizing efficiency. However, in a world where algorithmic certainty risks becoming an Orwellian tool of epistemic control, true intellectual growth demands not passive acceptance but active struggle. Drawing on the dystopian visions of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick - where reality is unstable, perception malleable, and truth contested - this paper introduces Cognitive Dissonance AI (CD-AI): a novel framework that deliberately sustains uncertainty rather than resolving it. CD-AI does not offer closure, but compels users to navigate contradictions, challenge biases, and wrestle with competing truths. By delaying resolution and promoting dialectical engagement, CD-AI enhances reflective reasoning, epistemic humility, critical thinking, and adaptability in complex decision-making. This paper examines the theoretical foundations of the approach, presents an implementation model, explores its application in domains such as ethics, law, politics, and science, and addresses key ethical concerns - including decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, cognitive manipulation, and bias in AI reasoning. In reimagining AI as an engine of doubt rather than a deliverer of certainty, CD-AI challenges dominant paradigms of AI-augmented reasoning and offers a new vision - one in which AI sharpens the mind not by resolving conflict, but by sustaining it. Rather than reinforcing Huxleyan complacency or pacifying the user into intellectual conformity, CD-AI echoes Nietzsche's vision of the Uebermensch - urging users to transcend passive cognition through active epistemic struggle.",

As remote operations increasingly rely on digital interfaces, sensors, and networked communication, AI-driven systems transform decision-making processes across domains such as air traffic control, industrial automation, and intelligent ports. However, the integration of AI introduces significant challenges, including the reconfiguration of human-AI team cognition, the need for adaptive AI memory that aligns with human distributed cognition, and the design of AI fallback operators to maintain continuity during communication disruptions. Drawing on theories of distributed and team cognition, we analyse how cognitive overload, loss of situational awareness, and impaired team coordination may arise in AI-supported environments. Based on real-world intelligent port scenarios, we propose research directions that aim to safeguard human reasoning and enhance collaborative decision-making in AI-augmented remote operations.",

He contended that typical connectionist approaches fail to meet these challenges and that the dialogue between linguistic theory and cognitive neuroscience will be relatively unproductive until the importance of these problems is widely recognised and the challenges answered by some technical innovation in connectionist modelling.

In this paper, we examine two major approaches enabled by recent large vision language models: 1) image captioning followed by a language-only LLM, and 2) vision language models, under zero-shot and fine-tuned setups.

    "abstract": "We propose a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for mental health diagnosis that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and constraint logic programming (CLP). Having a CDSS is important because of the high complexity of diagnostic manuals used by mental health professionals and the danger of diagnostic errors. Our CDSS is a software tool that uses an LLM to translate diagnostic manuals to a logic program and solves the program using an off-the-shelf CLP engine to query a patient's diagnosis based on the encoded rules and provided data. By giving domain experts the opportunity to inspect the LLM-generated logic program, and making modifications when needed, our CDSS ensures that the diagnosis is not only accurate but also interpretable. We experimentally compare it with two baseline approaches of using LLMs: diagnosing patients using the LLM-only approach, and using the LLM-generated logic program but without expert inspection. The results show that, while LLMs are extremely useful in generating candidate logic programs, these programs still require expert inspection and modification to guarantee faithfulness to the official diagnostic manuals. Additionally, ethical concerns arise from the direct use of patient data in LLMs, underscoring the need for a safer hybrid approach like our proposed method.",

    "title": "Large Language Models as Psychological Simulators: A Methodological Guide",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations, methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review. Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and prompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.",

    "title": "ExpTrialMng: A Universal Experiment Trial Manager for AR/VR/MR Experiments based on Unity",
    "abstract": "Based on the improvement of recent virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) Head Mounted Display (HMD), there have been attempts to adopt VR and AR in various fields. Since VR and AR could provide more immersive experimental environments and stimuli than 2D settings in a cost-efficient way, psychological and cognitive researchers are particularly interested in using these platforms. However, there is still an entry barrier for researchers who are not familiar with Unity programming, and current VR/AR HMDs could also cause unexpected errors during the experiment. Therefore, we developed a Unity library that can be adopted in various experiments universally and assist researchers in developing their own. Our library provides functions related to trial assignment and results saving. That way, researchers can easily implement the essential functions of their psychological experiments. We also made a function that enables proceeding with the experiment from a specific trial point to handle unexpected errors caused by HMD tracking loss issues during the experiment. We expect our library could invite researchers from various disciplines and help them acquire valuable insights in VR/AR environments.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive dissonance theory proposes that individuals experience psychological discomfort when they hold two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, or when their beliefs are inconsistent with their actions. This dissonance creates a motivational drive to reduce the inconsistency by changing beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. The theory explains various phenomena including attitude change, decision justification, and effort justification. Cognitive dissonance can be reduced through changing cognitions, adding new cognitions, or decreasing the importance of conflicting cognitions.",
