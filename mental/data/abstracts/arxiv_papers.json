    "abstract": "Understanding mind-brain-environment relations is one of the key topics in psychology. Kurt Lewin, inspired by theoretical physics, tried to establish topological and vector psychology analyzing patterns of interaction between the individual and her/his environment. The time is ripe to reformulate his ambitious goals, searching for ways to interpret objectively measured brain processes in terms of suitable psychological constructs. Connecting cognitive and social psychology constructs to neurophenomics, as it is done now in psychiatry, should ground them in physical reality.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to promote quantum logic as one of the basic tools for analyzing human reasoning. We compare it with classical (Boolean) logic and highlight the role of violation of the distributive law for conjunction and disjunction. It is well known that nondistributivity is equivalent to incompatibility of logical variables -- the impossibility to assign jointly the two-valued truth values to these variables. A natural question arises as to whether quantum logical nondistributivity in human logic can be tested experimentally. We show that testing the response replicability effect (RRE) in cognitive psychology is equivalent to testing nondistributivity -- under the prevailing conjecture that the mental state update generated by observation is described as orthogonal projection of the mental state vector (the projective update conjecture of Wang and Busemeyer). A simple test of RRE is suggested. In contrast to the previous works in quantum-like modeling, we proceed in the state-dependent framework; in particular, distributivity, compatibility, and RRE are considered in a fixed mental state. In this framework, we improve the previous result on the impossibility to combine question order and response replicability effects by using (von Neumann-Lüders) projective measurements.",

While most opportunities taken up by the VIS community will likely focus on the psychology of users, there are also opportunities for studying the psychology of designers. In this position paper, I argue the importance of studying design cognition as a necessary component of a holistic program of research on visualization psychology. I provide a brief overview of research on design cognition in other disciplines, and discuss opportunities for VIS to build an analogous research program. Doing so can lead to a stronger integration of research and design practice, can provide a better understanding of how to educate and train future designers, and will likely surface both challenges and opportunities for future research.",

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as potent tools increasingly capable of performing human-level tasks. The recent development in the form of GPT-4 and its demonstrated success in tasks complex to humans exam and complex problems has led to an increased confidence in the LLMs to become perfect instruments of intelligence. Although GPT-4 report has shown performance on some cognitive psychology tasks, a comprehensive assessment of GPT-4, via the existing well-established datasets is required. In this study, we focus on the evaluation of GPT-4's performance on a set of cognitive psychology datasets such as CommonsenseQA, SuperGLUE, MATH and HANS. In doing so, we understand how GPT-4 processes and integrates cognitive psychology with contextual information, providing insight into the underlying cognitive processes that enable its ability to generate the responses. We show that GPT-4 exhibits a high level of accuracy in cognitive psychology tasks relative to the prior state-of-the-art models. Our results strengthen the already available assessments and confidence on GPT-4's cognitive psychology abilities. It has significant potential to revolutionize the field of AI, by enabling machines to bridge the gap between human and machine reasoning.",

    "abstract": "The present communication addresses a set of observations, obeying both deterministic as well as statistical formal requirements, and serving to operate within the framework of the dynamical systems theory, with a certain emphasis placed on initial data. It is argued that statistical approaches can manifest themselves non unequivocally, leading to certain virtual discrepancies in psychological and/or cognitive data analyses, termed sometimes in literature as, questionable research practices. This communication points to the demand for a deep awareness of the data origins, which can indicate whether the exponential (Malthus type) or the algebraic (Pareto type) statistical distribution ought to be effectively considered in practical interpretation. This is also related to the question of how frequently patients behave in a specific way, and the significance of these behaviors in determining a patient's progression or regression, involving a certain memory effect. In this perspective, it is discussed how a sensitively applied hazardous or triggering factor can be helpful for well-controlled psychological strategic treatments, also those attributable to obsessive/compulsive disorders or even self-injurious behaviors, with their both criticality and complexity exploiting relations between a therapist and a patient.",

Fifthly, standards for visualization and presentation of mechanisms, cognition mechanisms, and the instances to mechanistically look at them are suggested and used to analyze cognition mechanisms through appropriate examples.

Since AI researchers benchmark a significant proportion of performance standards through human intelligence, cognitive sciences-inspired AI is a promising domain of research. Studying cognitive science can provide a fresh perspective to building fundamental blocks in AI research, which can lead to improved performance and efficiency. In this review paper, we focus on the cognitive functions of perception, which is the process of taking signals from one's surroundings as input, and processing them to understand the environment. Particularly, we study and compare its various processes through the lens of both cognitive sciences and AI. Through this study, we review all current major theories from various sub-disciplines of cognitive science (specifically neuroscience, psychology and linguistics), and draw parallels with theories and techniques from current practices in AI. We, hence, present a detailed collection of methods in AI for researchers to build AI systems inspired by cognitive science. Further, through the process of reviewing the state of cognitive-inspired AI, we point out many gaps in the current state of AI (with respect to the performance of the human brain), and hence present potential directions for researchers to develop better perception systems in AI.",

More specifically, we assess GPT-3's decision-making, information search, deliberation, and causal reasoning abilities on a battery of canonical experiments from the literature. We find that much of GPT-3's behavior is impressive: it solves vignette-based tasks similarly or better than human subjects, is able to make decent decisions from descriptions, outperforms humans in a multi-armed bandit task, and shows signatures of model-based reinforcement learning. Yet we also find that small perturbations to vignette-based tasks can lead GPT-3 vastly astray, that it shows no signatures of directed exploration, and that it fails miserably in a causal reasoning task. These results enrich our understanding of current large language models and pave the way for future investigations using tools from cognitive psychology to study increasingly capable and opaque artificial agents.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved unprecedented performance on a wide range of complex tasks, rapidly outpacing our understanding of the nature of their solutions. This has caused a recent surge of interest in methods for rendering modern neural systems more interpretable. In this work, we propose to address the interpretability problem in modern DNNs using the rich history of problem descriptions, theories and experimental methods developed by cognitive psychologists to study the human mind. To explore the potential value of these tools, we chose a well-established analysis from developmental psychology that explains how children learn word labels for objects, and applied that analysis to DNNs. Using datasets of stimuli inspired by the original cognitive psychology experiments, we find that state-of-the-art one shot learning models trained on ImageNet exhibit a similar bias to that observed in humans: they prefer to categorize objects according to shape rather than color. The magnitude of this shape bias varies greatly among architecturally identical, but differently seeded models, and even fluctuates within seeds throughout training, despite nearly equivalent classification performance. These results demonstrate the capability of tools from cognitive psychology for exposing hidden computational properties of DNNs, while concurrently providing us with a computational model for human word learning.",

    "abstract": "Background: Exploration of the physical environment is an indispensable precursor to information acquisition and knowledge consolidation for living organisms. Yet, current artificial intelligence models lack these autonomy capabilities during training, hindering their adaptability. This work proposes a learning framework for artificial agents to obtain an intrinsic exploratory drive, based on epistemic and achievement emotions triggered during data observation. Methods: This study proposes a dual-module reinforcement framework, where data analysis scores dictate pride or surprise, in accordance with psychological studies on humans. A correlation between these states and exploration is then optimized for agents to meet their learning goals. Results: Causal relationships between states and exploration are demonstrated by the majority of agents. A 15.4\\% mean increase is noted for surprise, with a 2.8\\% mean decrease for pride. Resulting correlations of $ρ_{surprise}=0.461$ and $ρ_{pride}=-0.237$ are obtained, mirroring previously reported human behavior. Conclusions: These findings lead to the conclusion that bio-inspiration for AI development can be of great use. This can incur benefits typically found in living beings, such as autonomy. Further, it empirically shows how AI methodologies can corroborate human behavioral findings, showcasing major interdisciplinary importance. Ramifications are discussed.",

One threat to the interdisciplinarity of Cognitive Science, both the field and journal, is that it may become, or already be, too dominated by psychologists. In 2005, psychology was a keyword for 51% of submissions, followed distantly by linguistics (17%), artificial intelligence (13%), neuroscience (10%), computer science (9%), and philosophy (8%). The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) gathers data not only on how individual articles cite one another, but also on macroscopic citation patterns among journals. Journals or sets of journals can be considered as proxies for fields. As fields become established, they often create journals. By studying the patterns of citations among journals that cite and are cited by Cognitive Science, we can better: 1) appreciate the scholarly ecology surrounding the journal and the journals role within this ecology, 2) establish competitor and alternate journals, and 3) determine the natural clustering of fields related to cognitive science.",

We present an algorithm -- quantum-like representation algorithm (QLRA) -- which provides a possibility to represent probabilistic data of any origin by complex probability amplitudes. Our conjecture is that cognitive systems developed the ability to use QLRA. They operate with complex probability amplitudes, mental wave functions. Since the mathematical formalism of QM describes as well (under some generalization) processing of such quantum-like (QL) mental states, the conventional quantum decision-making scheme can be used by the brain. We consider a modification of this scheme to describe decision-making in the presence of two ``incompatible'' mental variables. Such a QL decision-making can be used in situations like Prisoners Dilemma (PD) as well as others corresponding to so called disjunction effect in psychology and cognitive science.",

    "abstract": "In lieu of an abstract here is the first paragraph: No other species remotely approaches the human capacity for the cultural evolution of novelty that is accumulative, adaptive, and open-ended (i.e., with no a priori limit on the size or scope of possibilities). By culture we mean extrasomatic adaptations--including behavior and technology--that are socially rather than sexually transmitted. This chapter synthesizes research from anthropology, psychology, archaeology, and agent-based modeling into a speculative yet coherent account of two fundamental cognitive transitions underlying human cultural evolution that is consistent with contemporary psychology. While the chapter overlaps with a more technical paper on this topic (Gabora & Smith 2018), it incorporates new research and elaborates a genetic component to our overall argument. The ideas in this chapter grew out of a non-Darwinian framework for cultural evolution, referred to as the Self-other Reorganization (SOR) theory of cultural evolution (Gabora, 2013, in press; Smith, 2013), which was inspired by research on the origin and earliest stage in the evolution of life (Cornish-Bowden & Cárdenas 2017; Goldenfeld, Biancalani, & Jafarpour, 2017, Vetsigian, Woese, & Goldenfeld 2006; Woese, 2002). SOR bridges psychological research on fundamental aspects of our human nature such as creativity and our proclivity to reflect on ideas from different perspectives, with the literature on evolutionary approaches to cultural evolution that aspire to synthesize the behavioral sciences much as has been done for the biological scientists. The current chapter is complementary to this effort, but less abstract; it attempts to ground the theory of cultural evolution in terms of cognitive transitions as suggested by archaeological evidence.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT (Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations. The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario, demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support, and advanced social psychology studies.",

The work is circumscribed to the use of \"open-source\" LLMs that can be run locally, thereby enhancing data privacy. Furthermore, it prioritizes models with low computational requirements, making it accessible to both individuals and institutions operating on limited computing budgets. The implemented strategy only relies on a carefully crafted prompt and a grammar to guide the LLM's text completion. Despite its simplicity, the evaluation metrics show outstanding results, making it a valuable privacy-focused and cost-effective approach.

    "title": "Interdisciplinary Methods in Computational Creativity: How Human Variables Shape Human-Inspired AI Research",
    "abstract": "The word creativity originally described a concept from human psychology, but in the realm of computational creativity (CC), it has become much more. The question of what creativity means when it is part of a computational system might be considered core to CC. Pinning down the meaning of creativity, and concepts like it, becomes salient when researchers port concepts from human psychology to computation, a widespread practice extending beyond CC into artificial intelligence (AI). Yet, the human processes shaping human-inspired computational systems have been little investigated. In this paper, we question which human literatures (social sciences, psychology, neuroscience) enter AI scholarship and how they are translated at the port of entry. This study is based on 22 in-depth, semi-structured interviews, primarily with human-inspired AI researchers, half of whom focus on creativity as a major research area. This paper focuses on findings most relevant to CC. We suggest that which human literature enters AI bears greater scrutiny because ideas may become disconnected from context in their home discipline. Accordingly, we recommend that CC researchers document the decisions and context of their practices, particularly those practices formalizing human concepts for machines. Publishing reflexive commentary on human elements in CC and AI would provide a useful record and permit greater dialogue with other disciplines.",

    "abstract": "The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques. Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques to function as an interactive \"Personality Brain.\" Finally, the entire suite of predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust, scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing, showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach, demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.",

On the one hand, the Gestalt computational model presents quantitative supports for Gestalt theory. On the other hand, it shows that the Gestalt principles can be uniformly calculated using persistent homology, thus developing a coherent theory for Gestalt principles in computation. Moreover, it is anticipated that the Gestalt computational model can serve as a significant computational model in the field of computational psychology, and help the understanding of human being visual perception.",

    "abstract": "Stereotypical language expresses widely-held beliefs about different social categories. Many stereotypes are overtly negative, while others may appear positive on the surface, but still lead to negative consequences. In this work, we present a computational approach to interpreting stereotypes in text through the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), a comprehensive causal theory from social psychology. The SCM proposes that stereotypes can be understood along two primary dimensions: warmth and competence. We present a method for defining warmth and competence axes in semantic embedding space, and show that the four quadrants defined by this subspace accurately represent the warmth and competence concepts, according to annotated lexicons. We then apply our computational SCM model to textual stereotype data and show that it compares favourably with survey-based studies in the psychological literature. Furthermore, we explore various strategies to counter stereotypical beliefs with anti-stereotypes. It is known that countering stereotypes with anti-stereotypical examples is one of the most effective ways to reduce biased thinking, yet the problem of generating anti-stereotypes has not been previously studied. Thus, a better understanding of how to generate realistic and effective anti-stereotypes can contribute to addressing pressing societal concerns of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.",

The idea is that news or advertisement should be able to engage the reader on emotional and behavioral platform. While achieving this objective there is need to learn about reader behavior and use computational psychology while presenting as well as writing news or advertisements. This paper based on Machine Learning, tries to map behavior of the reader with the news/advertisements and also provide inputs for affective value for building personalized news or advertisements presentations. The affective value of the news is determined and news artifacts are mapped to reader. The algorithm suggests the most suitable news for readers while understanding emotional traits required for personalization. This work can be used to improve reader satisfaction through embedding emotions in the reading material and prioritizing news presentations. It can be used to map personal reading material range, personalized programs and ranking programs, advertisements with reference to individuals.",

Temporal information is required for higher-level cognitive abilities such as planning, decision making, communication, and effective cooperation. Since time is an inseparable part of cognition, there is a growing interest in the artificial intelligence approach to subjective time, which has a possibility of advancing the field. The current survey study aims to provide researchers with an interdisciplinary perspective on time perception. Firstly, we introduce a brief background from the psychology and neuroscience literature, covering the characteristics and models of time perception and related abilities. Secondly, we summarize the emergent computational and robotic models of time perception. A general overview to the literature reveals that a substantial amount of timing models are based on a dedicated time processing like the emergence of a clock-like mechanism from the neural network dynamics and reveal a relationship between the embodiment and time perception. We also notice that most models of timing are developed for either sensory timing (i.e. ability to assess an interval) or motor timing (i.e. ability to reproduce an interval). The number of timing models capable of retrospective timing, which is the ability to track time without paying attention, is insufficient. In this light, we discuss the possible research directions to promote interdisciplinary collaboration in the field of time perception.",

Disaster psychology has been seen as an emerging area of research and practice which deals with understanding of the psychological impact of individuals and community aftermath of the disasters. The aim of this paper is to put forward the conceptualization and development of dynamic networked psychology as a theoretical framework and its implications in exploring emotional contagion during disasters. We advocate theories of structural network dynamics can be used to construct DNP for exploring individuals as well as community coping mechanisms for improving preparedness, response and recovery of disasters. The advent of computational social science promotes the empirical modelling and analysis of massive volume of user data by inferring meaningful patterns for finding answers to important social and behavioral science research questions dealing with individual and community coping ability. In presenting a theoretical framework, we suggest that the underlying assumptions and integration of theories of social influence can be used to explore networks of emotional contagion for disasters.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology, serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and computational models of cognition. However, the application of human measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing \"I am anxious\"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a theory of creativity, referred to as honing theory, which posits that creativity fuels the process by which culture evolves through communal exchange amongst minds that are self-organizing, self-maintaining, and self-reproducing. According to honing theory, minds, like other selforganizing systems, modify their contents and adapt to their environments to minimize entropy. Creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy material, which provokes uncertainty and is arousalinducing. The creative process involves recursively considering this material from new contexts until it is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates. Restructuring involves neural synchrony and dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily shifting to a more associative mode of thought. A creative work may similarly induce restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural evolution of more nuanced worldviews. Since lines of cultural descent connecting creative outputs may exhibit little continuity, it is proposed that cultural evolution occurs at the level of self-organizing minds, outputs reflect their evolutionary state. Honing theory addresses challenges not addressed by other theories of creativity, such as the factors that guide restructuring, and in what sense creative works evolve. Evidence comes from empirical studies, an agent-based computational model of cultural evolution, and a model of concept combination.",

In the experiments, we first examined psychological state of 64 participants and asked them to summarize the story of a book, Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Marquez, 1981). Secondly, we trained models using crawled 365,802 movie review data; then we evaluated participants' summaries using the pretrained model as a concept of transfer learning. With the background that emotion affects on memories, we investigated the relationship between the evaluation score of the summaries from computational models and the examined psychological measurements. The result shows that although CNN performed the best among other deep neural network algorithms (LSTM, GRU), its results are not related to the psychological state. Rather, GRU shows more explainable results depending on the psychological state. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) we enlighten the relationship between computational models and psychological measurements. (2) we suggest this framework as objective methods to evaluate the emotion; the real sentiment analysis of a person.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging the synergy between causal knowledge graphs and a large language model (LLM), our study introduces a groundbreaking approach for computational hypothesis generation in psychology. We analyzed 43,312 psychology articles using a LLM to extract causal relation pairs. This analysis produced a specialized causal graph for psychology. Applying link prediction algorithms, we generated 130 potential psychological hypotheses focusing on `well-being', then compared them against research ideas conceived by doctoral scholars and those produced solely by the LLM. Interestingly, our combined approach of a LLM and causal graphs mirrored the expert-level insights in terms of novelty, clearly surpassing the LLM-only hypotheses (t(59) = 3.34, p=0.007 and t(59) = 4.32, p<0.001, respectively). This alignment was further corroborated using deep semantic analysis. Our results show that combining LLM with machine learning techniques such as causal knowledge graphs can revolutionize automated discovery in psychology, extracting novel insights from the extensive literature. This work stands at the crossroads of psychology and artificial intelligence, championing a new enriched paradigm for data-driven hypothesis generation in psychological research.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we develop a pipeline for historical-psychological text analysis in classical Chinese. Humans have produced texts in various languages for thousands of years; however, most of the computational literature is focused on contemporary languages and corpora. The emerging field of historical psychology relies on computational techniques to extract aspects of psychology from historical corpora using new methods developed in natural language processing (NLP). The present pipeline, called Contextualized Construct Representations (CCR), combines expert knowledge in psychometrics (i.e., psychological surveys) with text representations generated via transformer-based language models to measure psychological constructs such as traditionalism, norm strength, and collectivism in classical Chinese corpora. Considering the scarcity of available data, we propose an indirect supervised contrastive learning approach and build the first Chinese historical psychology corpus (C-HI-PSY) to fine-tune pre-trained models. We evaluate the pipeline to demonstrate its superior performance compared with other approaches. The CCR method outperforms word-embedding-based approaches across all of our tasks and exceeds prompting with GPT-4 in most tasks. Finally, we benchmark the pipeline against objective, external data to further verify its validity.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability: Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely with trivial rephrasing. These \"measurement phantoms\"--statistical artifacts masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1) explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements, (2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4) execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through an example of model evaluation--\"LLM selfhood\"--showing how systematic validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical foundation for AI psychology research.",

In our task setup, we compare several approaches to predicting which word an individual performing SFT will utter next. We report preliminary evidence suggesting that, despite obvious implementational differences in how people and TLMs learn and use language, TLMs can be used to identify individual differences in human fluency task behaviors better than existing computational models, and may offer insights into human memory retrieval strategies -- cognitive process not typically considered to be the kinds of things TLMs can model.

    "title": "Beyond DAGs: Modeling Causal Feedback with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps",
    "abstract": "Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) model feedback causal relations in interwoven webs of causality and policy variables. FCMs are fuzzy signed directed graphs that allow degrees of causal influence and event occurrence. Such causal models can simulate a wide range of policy scenarios and decision processes. Their directed loops or cycles directly model causal feedback. Their nonlinear dynamics permit forward-chaining inference from input causes and policy options to output effects. Users can add detailed dynamics and feedback links directly to the causal model or infer them with statistical learning laws. Users can fuse or combine FCMs from multiple experts by weighting and adding the underlying fuzzy edge matrices and do so recursively if needed. The combined FCM tends to better represent domain knowledge as the expert sample size increases if the expert sample approximates a random sample. Many causal models use more restrictive directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and Bayesian probabilities. DAGs do not model causal feedback because they do not contain closed loops. Combining DAGs also tends to produce cycles and thus tends not to produce a new DAG. Combining DAGs tends to produce a FCM. FCM causal influence is also transitive whereas probabilistic causal influence is not transitive in general. Overall: FCMs trade the numerical precision of probabilistic DAGs for pattern prediction, faster and scalable computation, ease of combination, and richer feedback representation. We show how FCMs can apply to problems of public support for insurgency and terrorism and to US-China conflict relations in Graham Allison's Thucydides-trap framework. The appendix gives the textual justification of the Thucydides-trap FCM. It also extends our earlier theorem [Osoba-Kosko2017] to a more general result that shows the transitive and total causal influence that upstream concept nodes exert on downstream nodes.",

In this work, we will continue the discussion from the perspective of methods which focus on the assumed cognitive abilities, limitations, and biases demonstrated in human reasoning.

Aspects of two neurodevelopmental disorders, autism and schizophrenia, are modelled using SOM networks, based on existing neurocomputational theories. Both standard and oscillating-TN SOM training is employed with targeted modifications in the TN width function. Computer simulations are conducted using revised versions of a previously introduced model (IPSOM) based on a new modelling hypothesis.\n  Results/Conclusions: The results demonstrate that there is strong similarity between standard and oscillating-TN SOM modelling in terms of map formation behaviour, output and structure, while the oscillating version offers a more realistic computational analogue of brain function. Neuroscientific and computational arguments are presented to validate the proposed SOM modification within a cognitive modelling framework.",

In this paper, we propose using spontaneous speech corpora to derive production variables (speech reductions, prosodic prominences) and applying them in a similar fashion. More precisely, we extract. We then test models trained with a standard procedure on different pretraining datasets (written, spoken, and mixed genres) for their ability to predict these two variables. Our results show that, after some fine-tuning, the models can predict these production variables well above baselines. We also observe that spoken genre training data provides more accurate predictions than written genres.

Informed by experiments with humans, we probe and compare four VLMs for a well-known human cross-modal preference, the bouba-kiki effect. We do not find conclusive evidence for this effect but suggest that results may depend on features of the models, such as architecture design, model size, and training details.

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) has the unique potential to offer access to medical imaging to anyone, everywhere. Devices have become ultra-portable and cost-effective, akin to the stethoscope. Nevertheless US image quality and diagnostic efficacy are still highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-image patients, image quality is often insufficient for reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we put forth that US imaging systems can be recast as information-seeking agents that engage in reciprocal interactions with their anatomical environment. Such agents autonomously adapt their transmit-receive sequences to fully personalize imaging and actively maximize information gain in-situ. To that end, we will show that the sequence of pulse-echo experiments that a US system performs can be interpreted as a perception-action loop: the action is the data acquisition, probing tissue with acoustic waves and recording reflections at the detection array, and perception is the inference of the anatomical and or functional state, potentially including associated diagnostic quantities. We then equip systems with a mechanism to actively reduce uncertainty and maximize diagnostic value across a sequence of experiments, treating action and perception jointly using Bayesian inference given generative models of the environment and action-conditional pulse-echo observations. Since the representation capacity of the generative models dictates both the quality of inferred anatomical states and the effectiveness of inferred sequences of future imaging actions, we will be greatly leveraging the enormous advances in deep generative modelling that are currently disrupting many fields and society at large. Finally, we show some examples of cognitive, closed-loop, US systems that perform active beamsteering and adaptive scanline selection, based on deep generative models that track anatomical belief states.",

Here, we model the emergence of cognitive structure capable of undergoing cultural evolution. Mental representations of knowledge and experiences play the role of catalytic molecules, and interactions amongst them (e.g., the forging of new associations) play the role of reactions, and result in representational redescription. The approach tags mental representations with their source, i.e., whether they were acquired through social learning, individual learning (of pre-existing information), or creative thought (resulting in the generation of new information). This makes it possible to model how cognitive structure emerges, and to trace lineages of cumulative culture step by step. We develop a formal representation of the cultural transition from Oldowan to Acheulean tool technology using Reflexively Autocatalytifc and Food set generated (RAF) networks. Unlike more primitive Oldowan stone tools, the Acheulean hand axe required not only the capacity to envision and bring into being something that did not yet exist, but hierarchically structured thought and action, and the generation of new mental representations: the concepts EDGING, THINNING, SHAPING, and a meta-concept, HAND AXE. We show how this constituted a key transition towards the emergence of semantic networks that were self-organizing, self-sustaining, and autocatalytic, and discuss how such networks replicated through social interaction. The model provides a promising approach to unraveling one of the greatest anthropological mysteries: that of why development of the Acheulean hand axe was followed by over a million years of cultural stasis.",

    "abstract": "The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.",

    "abstract": "Designing recommendation systems that serve content aligned with time varying preferences requires proper accounting of the feedback effects of recommendations on human behavior and psychological condition. We argue that modeling the influence of recommendations on people's preferences must be grounded in psychologically plausible models. We contribute a methodology for developing grounded dynamic preference models. We demonstrate this method with models that capture three classic effects from the psychology literature: Mere-Exposure, Operant Conditioning, and Hedonic Adaptation. We conduct simulation-based studies to show that the psychological models manifest distinct behaviors that can inform system design. Our study has two direct implications for dynamic user modeling in recommendation systems. First, the methodology we outline is broadly applicable for psychologically grounding dynamic preference models. It allows us to critique recent contributions based on their limited discussion of psychological foundation and their implausible predictions. Second, we discuss implications of dynamic preference models for recommendation systems evaluation and design. In an example, we show that engagement and diversity metrics may be unable to capture desirable recommendation system performance.",

These agents deliberate and interact to determine the system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment with human psychology.

    "abstract": "Memory behavior modeling is a core issue in cognitive psychology and education. Classical psychological theories typically use memory equations to describe memory behavior, which exhibits insufficient accuracy and controversy, while data-driven memory modeling methods often require large amounts of training data and lack interpretability. Knowledge-informed neural network models have shown excellent performance in fields like physics, but there have been few attempts in the domain of behavior modeling. This paper proposed a psychology theory informed neural networks for memory behavior modeling named PsyINN, where it constructs a framework that combines neural network with differentiating sparse regression, achieving joint optimization. Specifically, to address the controversies and ambiguity of descriptors in memory equations, a descriptor evolution method based on differentiating operators is proposed to achieve precise characterization of descriptors and the evolution of memory theoretical equations. Additionally, a buffering mechanism for the sparse regression and a multi-module alternating iterative optimization method are proposed, effectively mitigating gradient instability and local optima issues. On four large-scale real-world memory behavior datasets, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy. Ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed refinements, and application experiments showcase its potential in inspiring psychological research.",

For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations, methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review. Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and prompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.",

    "abstract": "Researchers are usually interested in examining the impact of covariates when separating heterogeneous samples into latent classes that are more homogeneous. The majority of theoretical and empirical studies with such aims have focused on identifying covariates as predictors of class membership in the structural equation modeling framework. In other words, the covariates only indirectly affect the sample heterogeneity. However, the covariates' influence on between-individual differences can also be direct. This article presents a mixture model that investigates covariates to explain within-cluster and between-cluster heterogeneity simultaneously, known as a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model. This study aims to extend the MoE framework to investigate heterogeneity in nonlinear trajectories: to identify latent classes, covariates as predictors to clusters, and covariates that explain within-cluster differences in change patterns over time. Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed model generally estimates the parameters unbiasedly, precisely and exhibits appropriate empirical coverage for a nominal 95% confidence interval. This study also proposes implementing structural equation model forests to shrink the covariate space of the proposed mixture model. We illustrate how to select covariates and construct the proposed model with longitudinal mathematics achievement data. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed mixture model can be further extended in the structural equation modeling framework by allowing the covariates that have direct effects to be time-varying.",

By incorporating emotional intelligence into AI agents, their emotional stability can be evaluated to enhance their resilience and dependability in critical decision-making tasks. In this work, we develop a methodology for modeling psychological disorders using Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. We utilized Appraisal theory to train RL agents in a dynamic grid world environment with an Appraisal-Guided Proximal Policy Optimization (AG-PPO) algorithm. Additionally, we investigated numerous reward-shaping strategies to simulate psychological disorders and regulate the behavior of the agents. A comparison of various configurations of the modified PPO algorithm identified variants that simulate Anxiety disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)-like behavior in agents. Furthermore, we compared standard PPO with AG-PPO and its configurations, highlighting the performance improvement in terms of generalization capabilities. Finally, we conducted an analysis of the agents' behavioral patterns in complex test environments to evaluate the associated symptoms corresponding to the psychological disorders. Overall, our work showcases the benefits of the appraisal-guided PPO algorithm over the standard PPO algorithm and the potential to simulate psychological disorders in a controlled artificial environment and evaluate them on RL agents.",

Drawing from concepts such as path-dependency, first-order autocorrelation, state-dependency, and hysteresis, the present study is an attempt to address how earlier responses serve as an anchor for subsequent answers in tests, surveys, and questionnaires. Introducing the notion of non-commuting observables derived from quantum physics, I highlight their role in characterizing psychological processes and the impact of measurement instruments on participants' responses. We advocate for the utilization of first-order Markov chain modeling to capture and forecast sequential dependencies in survey and test responses. The employment of the first-order Markov chain model lies in individuals' propensity to exhibit partial focus to preceding responses, with recent items most likely exerting a substantial influence on subsequent response selection. This study contributes to advancing our understanding of the dynamics inherent in sequential data within psychological research and provides a methodological framework for conducting longitudinal analyses of response patterns of test and questionnaire.",

    "abstract": "Researchers continue to be interested in exploring the effects that covariates have on the heterogeneity in trajectories. The inclusion of covariates associated with latent classes allows for a more clear understanding of individual differences and a more meaningful interpretation of latent class membership. Many theoretical and empirical studies have focused on investigating heterogeneity in change patterns of a univariate repeated outcome and examining the effects on baseline covariates that inform the cluster formation. However, developmental processes rarely unfold in isolation; therefore, empirical researchers often desire to examine two or more outcomes over time, hoping to understand their joint development where these outcomes and their change patterns are correlated. This study examines the heterogeneity in parallel nonlinear trajectories and identifies baseline characteristics as predictors of latent classes. Our simulation studies show that the proposed model can tell the clusters of parallel trajectories apart and provide unbiased and accurate point estimates with target coverage probabilities for the parameters of interest in general. We illustrate how to apply the model to investigate the heterogeneity in the joint development of reading and mathematics ability from Grade K to 5. In this real-world example, we also demonstrate how to select covariates that contribute the most to the latent classes and transform candidate covariates from a large set into a more manageable set with retaining the meaningful properties of the original set in the structural equation modeling framework.",

    "abstract": "As AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, their potential to exacerbate or trigger severe psychological harms remains poorly understood and inadequately tested. This paper presents a proactive methodology for systematically exploring psychological risks in simulated human-AI interactions based on documented real-world cases involving AI-induced or AI-exacerbated addiction, anorexia, depression, homicide, psychosis, and suicide. We collected and analyzed 18 reported real-world cases where AI interactions contributed to severe psychological outcomes. From these cases, we developed a process to extract harmful interaction patterns and assess potential risks through 2,160 simulated scenarios using clinical staging models. We tested four major LLMs across multi-turn conversations to identify where psychological risks emerge: which harm domains, conversation stages, and contexts reveal system vulnerabilities. Through the analysis of 157,054 simulated conversation turns, we identify critical gaps in detecting psychological distress, responding appropriately to vulnerable users, and preventing harm escalation. Regression analysis reveals variability across persona types: LLMs tend to perform worse with elderly users but better with low- and middle-income groups compared to high-income groups. Clustering analysis of harmful responses reveals a taxonomy of fifteen distinct failure patterns organized into four categories of AI-enabled harm. This work contributes a novel methodology for identifying psychological risks, empirical evidence of common failure modes across systems, and a classification of harmful AI response patterns in high-stakes human-AI interactions.",

This success is due in part to the ability of DNNs to learn useful representations of high-dimensional inputs, a problem that humans must also solve. We examine the relationship between the representations learned by these networks and human psychological representations recovered from similarity judgments. We find that deep features learned in service of object classification account for a significant amount of the variance in human similarity judgments for a set of animal images. However, these features do not capture some qualitative distinctions that are a key part of human representations. To remedy this, we develop a method for adapting deep features to align with human similarity judgments, resulting in image representations that can potentially be used to extend the scope of psychological experiments.",

However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling. Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing, preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client. Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Yet, this result also highlighted the possibility of observing violations of the predictions of the Born rule, in those situations where the averaging would not be large enough, or would be altered because of the combination of multiple measurements. In this article we show that this is indeed the case in typical psychological measurements exhibiting question order effects, by showing that their statistics of outcomes are inherently non-Hilbertian, and require the larger framework of the GTR-model to receive an exact mathematical description. We also consider another unsolved problem of quantum cognition: response replicability. It is has been observed that when question order effects and response replicability occur together, the situation cannot be handled anymore by quantum theory. However, we show that it can be easily and naturally described in the GTR-model. Based on these findings, we motivate the adoption in cognitive science of a hidden-measurements interpretation of the quantum formalism, and of its GTR-model generalization, as the natural interpretational framework explaining the data of psychological measurements on conceptual entities.",

As a result, PREs are often much less complex than full decision tree ensembles, while they have been found to provide similar predictive accuracy in many situations. The current paper introduces the methodology and shows how PREs can be fitted using the R package pre through several real-data examples from psychological research. The examples also illustrate a number of features of package \\textbf{pre} that may be particularly useful for applications in psychology: support for categorical, multivariate and count responses, application of (non-)negativity constraints, inclusion of confirmatory rules and standardized variable importance measures.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has enabled major advances across most areas of artificial intelligence research. This remarkable progress extends beyond mere engineering achievements and holds significant relevance for the philosophy of cognitive science. Deep neural networks have made significant strides in overcoming the limitations of older connectionist models that once occupied the centre stage of philosophical debates about cognition. This development is directly relevant to long-standing theoretical debates in the philosophy of cognitive science. Furthermore, ongoing methodological challenges related to the comparative evaluation of deep neural networks stand to benefit greatly from interdisciplinary collaboration with philosophy and cognitive science. The time is ripe for philosophers to explore foundational issues related to deep learning and cognition; this perspective paper surveys key areas where their contributions can be especially fruitful.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in the cognitive sciences is discovering the dynamics that govern behaviour. Take the example of spoken language, which is characterised by a highly variable and complex set of physical movements that map onto the small set of cognitive units that comprise language. What are the fundamental dynamical principles behind the movements that structure speech production? In this study, we discover models in the form of symbolic equations that govern articulatory gestures during speech. A sparse symbolic regression algorithm is used to discover models from kinematic data on the tongue and lips. We explore these candidate models using analytical techniques and numerical simulations, and find that a second-order linear model achieves high levels of accuracy, but a nonlinear force is required to properly model articulatory dynamics in approximately one third of cases. This supports the proposal that an autonomous, nonlinear, second-order differential equation is a viable dynamical law for articulatory gestures in speech. We conclude by identifying future opportunities and obstacles in data-driven model discovery and outline prospects for discovering the dynamical principles that govern language, brain and behaviour.",

He contended that typical connectionist approaches fail to meet these challenges and that the dialogue between linguistic theory and cognitive neuroscience will be relatively unproductive until the importance of these problems is widely recognised and the challenges answered by some technical innovation in connectionist modelling.

    "abstract": "Cognitive Computing (COC) aims to build highly cognitive machines with low computational resources that respond in real-time. However, scholarly literature shows varying research areas and various interpretations of COC. This calls for a cohesive architecture that delineates the nature of COC. We argue that if Herbert Simon considered the design science is the science of artificial, cognitive systems are the products of cognitive science or 'the newest science of the artificial'. Therefore, building a conceptual basis for COC is an essential step into prospective cognitive computing-based systems. This paper proposes an architecture of COC through analyzing the literature on COC using a myriad of statistical analysis methods. Then, we compare the statistical analysis results with previous qualitative analysis results to confirm our findings. The study also comprehensively surveys the recent research on COC to identify the state of the art and connect the advances in varied research disciplines in COC. The study found that there are three underlaying computing paradigms, Von-Neuman, Neuromorphic Engineering and Quantum Computing, that comprehensively complement the structure of cognitive computation. The research discuss possible applications and open research directions under the COC umbrella.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine an assumption that generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools can overcome the cognitive intensity that humans suffer when solving problems. We compared the performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on 2019 NAEP science assessments with students by cognitive demands of the items. Fifty-four tasks were coded by experts using a two-dimensional cognitive load framework, including task cognitive complexity and dimensionality. ChatGPT and GPT-4 responses were scored using the scoring keys of NAEP. The analysis of the available data was based on the average student ability scores for students who answered each item correctly and the percentage of students who responded to individual items. Results showed that both ChatGPT and GPT-4 consistently outperformed most students who answered the NAEP science assessments. As the cognitive demand for NAEP tasks increases, statistically higher average student ability scores are required to correctly address the questions. This pattern was observed for students in grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. However, ChatGPT and GPT-4 were not statistically sensitive to the increase in cognitive demands of the tasks, except for Grade 4. As the first study focusing on comparing GAI and K-12 students in problem-solving in science, this finding implies the need for changes to educational objectives to prepare students with competence to work with GAI tools in the future. Education ought to emphasize the cultivation of advanced cognitive skills rather than depending solely on tasks that demand cognitive intensity. This approach would foster critical thinking, analytical skills, and the application of knowledge in novel contexts. Findings also suggest the need for innovative assessment practices by moving away from cognitive intensity tasks toward creativity and analytical skills to avoid the negative effects of GAI on testing more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "During their first years of life, infants learn the language(s) of their environment at an amazing speed despite large cross cultural variations in amount and complexity of the available language input. Understanding this simple fact still escapes current cognitive and linguistic theories. Recently, spectacular progress in the engineering science, notably, machine learning and wearable technology, offer the promise of revolutionizing the study of cognitive development. Machine learning offers powerful learning algorithms that can achieve human-like performance on many linguistic tasks. Wearable sensors can capture vast amounts of data, which enable the reconstruction of the sensory experience of infants in their natural environment. The project of 'reverse engineering' language development, i.e., of building an effective system that mimics infant's achievements appears therefore to be within reach. Here, we analyze the conditions under which such a project can contribute to our scientific understanding of early language development. We argue that instead of defining a sub-problem or simplifying the data, computational models should address the full complexity of the learning situation, and take as input the raw sensory signals available to infants. This implies that (1) accessible but privacy-preserving repositories of home data be setup and widely shared, and (2) models be evaluated at different linguistic levels through a benchmark of psycholinguist tests that can be passed by machines and humans alike, (3) linguistically and psychologically plausible learning architectures be scaled up to real data using probabilistic/optimization principles from machine learning. We discuss the feasibility of this approach and present preliminary results.",

    "abstract": "While the modern science is characterized by an exponential growth in scientific literature, the increase in publication volume clearly does not reflect the expansion of the cognitive boundaries of science. Nevertheless, most of the metrics for assessing the vitality of science or for making funding and policy decisions are based on productivity. Similarly, the increasing level of knowledge production by large science teams, whose results often enjoy greater visibility, does not necessarily mean that \"big science\" leads to cognitive expansion. Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the extents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature independently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles published over 60-130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method is based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research articles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent stochasticity of article titles to achieve <1% precision. We show that the periods of cognitive growth do not necessarily coincide with the trends in publication volume. Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger teams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of) articles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries of science. The proposed method of quantifying the extent of the cognitive territory can also be applied to study many other aspects of \"science of science.\"",

However, the two disciplines differ substantially in the specific research questions. Cognitive science focuses on analyzing the specific mechanism of the brain and investigating the brain's response to language; few studies have examined the brain's language system as a whole. By contrast, computer scientists focus on the efficiency of practical applications when choosing research questions but may ignore the most essential laws of language. Given these differences, can a combination of the disciplines offer new insights for building intelligent language models and studying language cognitive mechanisms? In the following text, we first review the research questions, history, and methods of language understanding in cognitive and computer science, focusing on the current progress and challenges. We then compare and contrast the research of language understanding in cognitive and computer sciences. Finally, we review existing work that combines insights from language cognition and language computation and offer prospects for future development trends.",

    "abstract": "Rapid individual cognitive phenotyping holds the potential to revolutionize domains as wide-ranging as personalized learning, employment practices, and precision psychiatry. Going beyond limitations imposed by traditional lab-based experiments, new efforts have been underway towards greater ecological validity and participant diversity to capture the full range of individual differences in cognitive abilities and behaviors across the general population. Building on this, we developed Skill Lab, a novel game-based tool that simultaneously assesses a broad suite of cognitive abilities while providing an engaging narrative. Skill Lab consists of six mini-games as well as 14 established cognitive ability tasks. Using a popular citizen science platform (N = 10725), we conducted a comprehensive validation in the wild of a game-based cognitive assessment suite. Based on the game and validation task data, we constructed reliable models to simultaneously predict eight cognitive abilities based on the users' in-game behavior. Follow-'-up validation tests revealed that the models can discriminate nuances contained within each separate cognitive ability as well as capture a shared main factor of generalized cognitive ability. Our game-based measures are five times faster to complete than the equivalent task-based measures and replicate previous findings on the decline of certain cognitive abilities with age in our large cross-sectional population sample (N = 6369). Taken together, our results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid in-the-wild systematic assessment of cognitive abilities as a promising first step towards population-scale benchmarking and individualized mental health diagnostics.",

This article has a three-fold goal. First, it presents and critiques methods to measure cognitive load. Second, it explores the distribution of load across search task stages. Finally, it seeks to improve our understanding of factors affecting cognitive load levels in information search. To this end, a controlled Web search experiment with forty-eight participants was conducted. Interaction logs were used to segment search tasks semi-automatically into task stages. Cognitive load was assessed using a new variant of the dual-task method. Average cognitive load was found to vary by search task stages. It was significantly higher during query formulation and user description of a relevant document as compared to examining search results and viewing individual documents. Semantic information shown next to the search results lists in one of the studied interfaces was found to decrease mental demands during query formulation and examination of the search results list. These findings demonstrate that changes in dynamic cognitive load can be detected within search tasks. Dynamic assessment of cognitive load is of core interest to information science because it enriches our understanding of cognitive demands imposed on people engaged in the search process by a task and the interactive information retrieval system employed.",

We demonstrate this method in the domain of moral decision-making, where standard experimental approaches often identify relevant principles that influence human judgments, but fail to generalize these findings to \"real world\" situations that place these principles in conflict.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from 54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18% net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive augmentation.",

Such Big Data opens unprecedented opportunities for investigating cognitive phenomena like perception, personality and information diffusion but requires suitable interpretable frameworks. Since social media data come from users' minds, worthy candidates for this challenge are cognitive networks, models of cognition giving structure to mental conceptual associations. This work outlines how cognitive network science can open new, quantitative ways for understanding cognition through online media, like: (i) reconstructing how users semantically and emotionally frame events with contextual knowledge unavailable to machine learning, (ii) investigating conceptual salience/prominence through knowledge structure in social discourse; (iii) studying users' personality traits like openness-to-experience, curiosity, and creativity through language in posts; (iv) bridging cognitive/emotional content and social dynamics via multilayer networks comparing the mindsets of influencers and followers. These advancements combine cognitive-, network- and computer science to understand cognitive mechanisms in both digital and real-world settings but come with limitations concerning representativeness, individual variability and data integration. Such aspects are discussed along the ethical implications of manipulating socio-cognitive data. In the future, reading cognitions through networks and social media can expose cognitive biases amplified by online platforms and relevantly inform policy making, education and markets about massive, complex cognitive trends.",

    "abstract": "Isolated perspectives have often paved the way for great scientific discoveries. However, many breakthroughs only emerged when moving away from singular views towards interactions. Discussions on Artificial Intelligence (AI) typically treat human and AI bias as distinct challenges, leaving their dynamic interplay and compounding potential largely unexplored. Recent research suggests that biased AI can amplify human cognitive biases, while well-calibrated systems might help mitigate them. In this position paper, I advocate for transcending beyond separate treatment of human and AI biases and instead focus on their interaction effects. I argue that a comprehensive framework, one that maps (compound human-AI) biases to mitigation strategies, is essential for understanding and protecting human cognition, and I outline concrete steps for its development.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of artificial intelligence integration on remote operations, emphasising its influence on both distributed and team cognition. As remote operations increasingly rely on digital interfaces, sensors, and networked communication, AI-driven systems transform decision-making processes across domains such as air traffic control, industrial automation, and intelligent ports. However, the integration of AI introduces significant challenges, including the reconfiguration of human-AI team cognition, the need for adaptive AI memory that aligns with human distributed cognition, and the design of AI fallback operators to maintain continuity during communication disruptions. Drawing on theories of distributed and team cognition, we analyse how cognitive overload, loss of situational awareness, and impaired team coordination may arise in AI-supported environments. Based on real-world intelligent port scenarios, we propose research directions that aim to safeguard human reasoning and enhance collaborative decision-making in AI-augmented remote operations.",

It posits that three embedded processing layers unfold concurrently in the human mind, and their traces are detectable in behavioral data: sequences of routinized/automated processes are observable in fluent translation production, cognitive/reflective thoughts lead to longer keystroke pauses, while affective/emotional states may be identified through characteristic typing and gazing patterns. Utilizing data from the CRITT Translation Process Research Database (TPR-DB), the article illustrates how the temporal structure of keystroke and gaze data can be related to the three assumed hidden mental processing strata. The article relates this embedded generative model to various theoretical frameworks, dual-process theories and Robinson's (2023) ideosomatic theory of translation, opening exciting new theoretical horizons for Cognitive Translation Studies, grounded in empirical data and evaluation.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for cognitive augmentation, but their current reactive nature limits their real-world applicability. This position paper explores the potential of context-aware cognitive augmentation, where LLMs dynamically adapt to users' cognitive states and task environments to provide appropriate support. Through a think-aloud study in an exhibition setting, we examine how individuals interact with multi-modal information and identify key cognitive challenges in structuring, retrieving, and applying knowledge. Our findings highlight the need for AI-driven cognitive support systems that integrate real-time contextual awareness, personalized reasoning assistance, and socially adaptive interactions. We propose a framework for AI augmentation that seamlessly transitions between real-time cognitive support and post-experience knowledge organization, contributing to the design of more effective human-centered AI systems.",

This network contains local hubs, which have many connections within their own communities, and connector hubs, which have connections diversely distributed across communities. A mechanistic understanding of these hubs and how they support cognition has not been demonstrated. Here, we leveraged individual differences in hub connectivity and cognition. We show that a model of hub connectivity accurately predicts the cognitive performance of 476 individuals in four distinct tasks. Moreover, there is a general optimal network structure for cognitive performance--individuals with diversely connected hubs and consequent modular brain networks exhibit increased cognitive performance, regardless of the task. Critically, we find evidence consistent with a mechanistic model in which connector hubs tune the connectivity of their neighbors to be more modular while allowing for task appropriate information integration across communities, which increases global modularity and cognitive performance.",

Results indicate dichotomous outcomes regarding perceived team cognition and performance metrics, as perceived team cognition was not predictive of performance. Performance metrics like team situational awareness and team score showed that teams composed of all human participants performed at a lower level than mixed human-AI teams, with the AI-only teams attaining the highest performance. Perceived team cognition was highest in human-only teams, with mixed composition teams reporting perceived team cognition 58% below the all-human teams. These results inform future mixed teams of the potential performance gains in utilizing mixed teams' over human-only teams in certain applications, while also highlighting mixed teams' adverse effects on perceived team cognition.",

To understand the relationship, we created a \\say{Matching the Pair} game that participants could play collaboratively with one of two robot types, Husky or Pepper. The goal was to understand if humans would trust the robot as a teammate while being in the game-playing situation that demanded a high level of cognitive load. Using a humanoid vs. a technical robot, we also investigated the impact of physical anthropomorphism and we furthermore tested the impact of robot error rate on subsequent judgments and behavior. Our results showed that there was an inversely proportional relationship between trust and cognitive load, suggesting that as the amount of cognitive load increased in the participants, their ratings of trust decreased. We also found a triple interaction impact between robot-type, error-rate and participant's ratings of trust. We found that participants perceived Pepper to be more trustworthy in comparison with the Husky robot after playing the game with both robots under high error-rate condition. On the contrary, Husky was perceived as more trustworthy than Pepper when it was depicted as featuring a low error-rate. Our results are interesting and call further investigation of the impact of physical anthropomorphism in combination with variable error-rates of the robot.",

We are only just now beginning to define the fundamental concepts and metrics to describe, characterize, and measure augmented and collaborative cognition. In this paper, the results of a cognitive augmentation experiment are discussed and we calculate the increase in cognitive accuracy and cognitive precision. In the case study, cognitively augmented problem solvers show an increase of 74% in cognitive accuracy (the ability to synthesize desired answers) and a 27% increase in cognitive precision (the ability to synthesize only desired answers). We offer a formal treatment of the case study results and propose cognitive accuracy and cognitive precision as standard metrics to describe and measure human cognitive augmentation.",

Adequately designed systems within this field allow teams composed of both humans and robots to work together effectively on tasks such as monitoring, exploration, and search and rescue operations. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning-based affective workload allocation controller specifically for multi-human multi-robot teams. The proposed controller can dynamically reallocate workloads based on the performance of the operators during collaborative missions with multi-robot systems. The operators' performances are evaluated through the scores of a self-reported questionnaire (i.e., subjective measurement) and the results of a deep learning-based cognitive workload prediction algorithm that uses physiological and behavioral data (i.e., objective measurement). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, we use a multi-human multi-robot CCTV monitoring task as an example and carry out comprehensive real-world experiments with 32 human subjects for both quantitative measurement and qualitative analysis. Our results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed controller and highlight the importance of incorporating both subjective and objective measurements of the operators' cognitive workload as well as seeking consent for workload transitions, to enhance the performance of multi-human multi-robot teams.",

    "abstract": "AI-augmented systems are traditionally designed to streamline human decision-making by minimizing cognitive load, clarifying arguments, and optimizing efficiency. However, in a world where algorithmic certainty risks becoming an Orwellian tool of epistemic control, true intellectual growth demands not passive acceptance but active struggle. Drawing on the dystopian visions of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick - where reality is unstable, perception malleable, and truth contested - this paper introduces Cognitive Dissonance AI (CD-AI): a novel framework that deliberately sustains uncertainty rather than resolving it. CD-AI does not offer closure, but compels users to navigate contradictions, challenge biases, and wrestle with competing truths. By delaying resolution and promoting dialectical engagement, CD-AI enhances reflective reasoning, epistemic humility, critical thinking, and adaptability in complex decision-making. This paper examines the theoretical foundations of the approach, presents an implementation model, explores its application in domains such as ethics, law, politics, and science, and addresses key ethical concerns - including decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, cognitive manipulation, and bias in AI reasoning. In reimagining AI as an engine of doubt rather than a deliverer of certainty, CD-AI challenges dominant paradigms of AI-augmented reasoning and offers a new vision - one in which AI sharpens the mind not by resolving conflict, but by sustaining it. Rather than reinforcing Huxleyan complacency or pacifying the user into intellectual conformity, CD-AI echoes Nietzsche's vision of the Uebermensch - urging users to transcend passive cognition through active epistemic struggle.",

Somatosensory cognition is the basis of our ability to act upon and to transform the physical world around us, to recognize objects on the basis of touch alone, and to grasp them with the right amount of force for lifting and manipulating them. Recent technology has permitted the wireless monitoring of grip force signals recorded from biosensors in the palm of the human hand to track and trace human grip forces deployed in cognitive tasks executed under conditions of variable sensory (visual, auditory) input. Non-invasive multi-finger grip force sensor technology can be exploited to explore functional interactions between somatosensory brain mechanisms and motor control, in particular during learning a novel and complex tasks where the planning and strategic execution of hand movements is essential. Under the light of a comprehensive overview of recent discoveries into the functional significance of human grip force variations, perspectives for future studies in cognition, in particular the cognitive control of strategic hand movements in robot-assisted precision tasks, are pointed out.",

However, we currently lack theoretically grounded fundamental metrics able to describe human or artificial cognition much less augmented and combined cognition. How do we measure thinking, cognition, information, and knowledge in an implementation-independent way? How can we tell how much thinking an artificial entity does and how much is done by a human? How can we measure the combined and possible even emergent effect of humans working together with intelligent artificial entities? These are some of the challenges for research-ers in this field. We first define a cognitive process as the transformation of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. We then review several existing and emerging information metrics based on entropy, processing effort, quantum physics, emergent capacity, and human concept learning. We then discuss how these fail to answer the above questions and provide guidelines for future re-search.",

    "abstract": "Cognition and language seem closely related to the human cognitive process, although they have not been studied and investigated in detail. Our brain is too complex to fully comprehend the structures and connectivity, as well as its functions, with the currently available technology such as electro-encephalography, positron emission tomography, or functional magnetic resonance imaging, and neurobiological data. Therefore, the exploration of neurobiological processes, such as cognition, requires substantially more related evidences, especially from in-vivo human experiments. Cognition and language are of inter-disciplinary nature and additional methodological support is needed from other disciplines, such as deep learning in the field of artificial intelligence, for example. In this paper, we have attempted to explain the neural mechanisms underlying \"cognition and language processing\" or \"cognition or thinking\" using a novel neural network model with several newly emerging developments such as neuronal resonance, in-vivo human fiber tractography or connectivity data, Engram and Hebbian hypothesis, human memory formation in the high brain areas, deep learning, and more recently developed neural memory concepts, the neural lexicon. The neural lexicon is developed via language by repeated exposure to the neural system, similar to multilayer signal processing in deep learning. We have derived a neural model to explain how human \"cognition and language processing\" or \"cognition and thinking\" works, with a focus on language, a universal medium of the human society. Although the proposed hypothesis is not fully based on experimental evidences, a substantial portion of the observations in this study is directly and indirectly supported by recent experimental findings and the theoretical bases of deep learning research.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the identification of 'identity' and 'indistinguishability' and strong experimental evidence for the presence of the associated Bose-Einstein statistics in human cognition and language, we argued in previous work for an extension of the research domain of quantum cognition. In addition to quantum complex vector spaces and quantum probability models, we showed that quantization itself, with words as quanta, is relevant and potentially important to human cognition. In the present work, we build on this result, and introduce a powerful radiation quantization scheme for human cognition. We show that the lack of independence of the Bose-Einstein statistics compared to the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics can be explained by the presence of a 'meaning dynamics', which causes words to be attracted to the same words. And so words clump together in the same states, a phenomenon well known for photons in the early years of quantum mechanics, leading to fierce disagreements between Planck and Einstein. Using a simple example, we introduce all the elements to get a better and detailed view of this 'meaning dynamics', such as micro and macro states, and Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac numbers and weights, and compare this example and its graphs, with the radiation quantization scheme of a Winnie the Pooh story, also with its graphs. By connecting a concept directly to human experience, we show that entanglement is a necessity for preserving the 'meaning dynamics' we identified, and it becomes clear in what way Fermi-Dirac addresses human memory. Within the human mind, as a crucial aspect of memory, in spaces with internal parameters, identical words can nevertheless be assigned different states and hence realize locally and contextually the necessary distinctiveness, structured by a Pauli exclusion principle, for human thought to thrive.",

Challenges arise when environments are highly dynamic, obscuring stimulus-behavior relationships. However, the majority of current research focuses on simulating human cognitive behaviors under ideal conditions, neglecting the influence of environmental disturbances. We propose CogReact, integrating drift-diffusion with deep reinforcement learning to simulate granular effects of dynamic environmental stimuli on human cognitive process. Quantitatively, it improves cognition modelling by considering temporal effect of environmental stimuli on cognitive process and captures both subject-specific and stimuli-specific behavioural differences. Qualitatively, it captures general trends in human cognitive process under stimuli, better than baselines. Our approach is examined in diverse environmental influences on various cognitive tasks. Overall, it demonstrates a powerful, data-driven methodology to simulate, align with, and understand the vagaries of human cognitive response in dynamic contexts.",

    "abstract": "Friendship is a fundamental characteristic of human beings and usually assumed to be reciprocal in nature. Despite this common expectation, in reality, not all friendships by default are reciprocal nor created equal. Here, we show that reciprocated friendships are more intimate and they are substantially different from those that are not. We examine the role of reciprocal ties in inducing more effective peer pressure in a cooperative arrangements setting and find that the directionality of friendship ties can significantly limit the ability to persuade others to act. Specifically, we observe a higher behavioral change and more effective peer-influence when subjects shared reciprocal ties with their peers compared to sharing unilateral ones. Moreover, through spreading process simulation, we find that although unilateral ties diffuse behaviors across communities, reciprocal ties play more important role at the early stages of the diffusion process.",

The proposed model has been identified by means of a Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm combined with a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) technique. A large set of loss data, evaluated by means of analytical loss formulas, has been considered for the identification of a compact behavioral model. The GP-MOO approach considers the inverter switching frequency, input voltage, duty-cycle and load resistance as model input variables, and the MOSFET gate driver voltage and resistance as parameters influencing the coefficients values of the identified loss formula. The behavioral model loss predictions confirm their reliability for a wide range of operating conditions.",

We discuss framing common problems in fields like healthcare, finance, and e-commerce as sequence modeling tasks, and address challenges related to constructing coherent sequences from fragmented data and disentangling complex behavior patterns. We present a framework for sequence modeling using Ensembles of Hidden Markov Models, which are lightweight, interpretable, and efficient. Our ensemble-based scoring method enables robust comparison across sequences of different lengths and enhances performance in scenarios with imbalanced or scarce data. The framework scales in real-world scenarios, is compatible with downstream feature-based modeling, and is applicable in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with results on a longitudinal human behavior dataset.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based Models (ABMs) are valuable tools for policy analysis. ABMs help analysts explore the emergent consequences of policy interventions in multi-agent decision-making settings. But the validity of inferences drawn from ABM explorations depends on the quality of the ABM agents' behavioral models. Standard specifications of agent behavioral models rely either on heuristic decision-making rules or on regressions trained on past data. Both prior specification modes have limitations. This paper examines the value of reinforcement learning (RL) models as adaptive, high-performing, and behaviorally-valid models of agent decision-making in ABMs. We test the hypothesis that RL agents are effective as utility-maximizing agents in policy ABMs. We also address the problem of adapting RL algorithms to handle multi-agency in games by adapting and extending methods from recent literature. We evaluate the performance of such RL-based ABM agents via experiments on two policy-relevant ABMs: a minority game ABM, and an ABM of Influenza Transmission. We run some analytic experiments on our AI-equipped ABMs e.g. explorations of the effects of behavioral heterogeneity in a population and the emergence of synchronization in a population. The experiments show that RL behavioral models are effective at producing reward-seeking or reward-maximizing behaviors in ABM agents. Furthermore, RL behavioral models can learn to outperform the default adaptive behavioral models in the two ABMs examined.",

    "abstract": "Influence among individuals is at the core of collective social phenomena such as the dissemination of ideas, beliefs or behaviors, social learning and the diffusion of innovations. Different mechanisms have been proposed to implement inter-agent influence in social models from the voter model, to majority rules, to the Granoveter model. Here we advance in this direction by confronting the recently introduced Social Influence and Recurrent Mobility (SIRM) model, that reproduces generic features of vote-shares at different geographical levels, with data in the US presidential elections. Our approach incorporates spatial and population diversity as inputs for the opinion dynamics while individuals' mobility provides a proxy for social context, and peer imitation accounts for social influence. The model captures the observed stationary background fluctuations in the vote-shares across counties. We study the so-called political strongholds, i.e., locations where the votes-shares for a party are systematically higher than average. A quantitative definition of a stronghold by means of persistence in time of fluctuations in the voting spatial distribution is introduced, and results from the US Presidential Elections during the period 1980-2012 are analyzed within this framework. We compare electoral results with simulations obtained with the SIRM model finding a good agreement both in terms of the number and the location of strongholds. The strongholds duration is also systematically characterized in the SIRM model. The results compare well with the electoral results data revealing an exponential decay in the persistence of the strongholds with time.",

We intend to investigate hoarding behaviors in response to the pandemic using large-scale social media data. First, we collect hoarding-related tweets shortly after the outbreak of the coronavirus. Next, we analyze the hoarding and anti-hoarding patterns of over 42,000 unique Twitter users in the United States from March 1 to April 30, 2020, and dissect the hoarding-related tweets by age, gender, and geographic location. We find the percentage of females in both hoarding and anti-hoarding groups is higher than that of the general Twitter user population. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we investigate the opinions expressed towards the hoarding behavior by categorizing these topics according to demographic and geographic groups. We also calculate the anxiety scores for the hoarding and anti-hoarding related tweets using a lexical approach. By comparing their anxiety scores with the baseline Twitter anxiety score, we reveal further insights. The LIWC anxiety mean for the hoarding-related tweets is significantly higher than the baseline Twitter anxiety mean. Interestingly, beer has the highest calculated anxiety score compared to other hoarded items mentioned in the tweets.",

As found by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 20 million Americans aged 12 years or older consumed illicit drugs in the past few 30 days. Given their ubiquity in everyday life, drug abuse related studies have received much and constant attention. However, most of the existing studies rely on surveys. Surveys present a fair number of problems because of their nature. Surveys on sensitive topics such as illicit drug use may not be answered truthfully by the people taking them. Selecting a representative sample to survey is another major challenge. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using big data from social media in order to understand illicit drug use behaviors. Instagram posts are collected using drug related terms by analyzing the hashtags supplied with each post. A large and dynamic dictionary of frequent illicit drug related slang is used to find these posts. These posts are studied to find common drug consumption behaviors with regard to time of day and week. Furthermore, by studying the accounts followed by the users of drug related posts, we hope to discover common interests shared by drug users.",

    "abstract": "When language models (LMs) are trained to forget (or \"unlearn'') a skill, how precisely does their behavior change? We study the behavior of transformer LMs in which tasks have been forgotten via fine-tuning on randomized labels. Such LMs learn to generate near-random predictions for individual examples in the \"training'' set used for forgetting. Across tasks, however, LMs exhibit extreme variability in whether LM predictions change on examples outside the training set. In some tasks (like entailment classification), forgetting generalizes robustly, and causes models to produce uninformative predictions on new task instances; in other tasks (like physical commonsense reasoning and scientific question answering) forgetting affects only the training examples, and models continue to perform the \"forgotten'' task accurately even for examples very similar to those that appeared in the training set. Dataset difficulty is not predictive of whether a behavior can be forgotten; instead, generalization in forgetting is (weakly) predicted by the confidence of LMs' initial task predictions and the variability of LM representations of training data, with low confidence and low variability both associated with greater generalization. Perhaps most surprisingly, random-label forgetting appears to be somewhat insensitive to the contents of the training set: for example, models trained on science questions with random labels continue to answer other science questions accurately, but begin to produce random labels on entailment classification tasks. Finally, we show that even generalizable forgetting is shallow: linear probes trained on LMs' representations can still perform tasks reliably after forgetting. Our results highlight the difficulty and unpredictability of performing targeted skill removal from models via fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Human drivers have limited and time-varying cognitive resources when making decisions in real-world traffic scenarios, which often leads to unique and stochastic behaviors that can not be explained by perfect rationality assumption, a widely accepted premise in modeling driving behaviors that presume drivers rationally make decisions to maximize their own rewards under all circumstances. To explicitly address this disadvantage, this study presents a novel driver behavior model that aims to capture the resource rationality and stochasticity of the human driver's behaviors in realistic longitudinal driving scenarios. The resource rationality principle can provide a theoretic framework to better understand the human cognition processes by modeling human's internal cognitive mechanisms as utility maximization subject to cognitive resource limitations, which can be represented as finite and time-varying preview horizons in the context of driving. An inverse resource rational-based stochastic inverse reinforcement learning approach (IRR-SIRL) is proposed to learn a distribution of the planning horizon and cost function of the human driver with a given series of human demonstrations. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with a time-varying horizon approach is used to generate driver-specific trajectories by using the learned distributions of the planning horizon and the cost function of the driver. The simulation experiments are carried out using human demonstrations gathered from the driver-in-the-loop driving simulator. The results reveal that the proposed inverse resource rational-based stochastic driver model can address the resource rationality and stochasticity of human driving behaviors in a variety of realistic longitudinal driving scenarios.",

Our analysis of the selected primary studies reveals that LLMs have demonstrated promising results in automatically generating use case and sequence diagrams.

However, a considerable number of studies in the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework usually start with vague hypotheses in terms of heterogeneity and possible reasons. It suggests that (1) the determination and specification of a proper model with covariates is not straightforward, and (2) the exploration process may be computational intensive given that a model in the SEM framework is usually complicated and the pool of candidate covariates is usually huge in the psychological and educational domain where the SEM framework is widely employed.

Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of clustering the nonlinear change patterns, and estimating the parameters of interest unbiasedly, precisely, as well as exhibiting appropriate confidence interval coverage. Considering the pool of candidate covariates is usually huge and highly correlated, this study also proposes implementing exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to reduce the dimension of covariate space. We illustrate how to use the hybrid method, the two-step GMM and EFA, to efficiently explore the heterogeneity of nonlinear trajectories of longitudinal mathematics achievement data.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the significant challenge of recognizing behaviors in non-human primates, specifically focusing on chimpanzees. Automated behavior recognition is crucial for both conservation efforts and the advancement of behavioral research. However, it is significantly hindered by the labor-intensive process of manual video annotation. Despite the availability of large-scale animal behavior datasets, the effective application of machine learning models across varied environmental settings poses a critical challenge, primarily due to the variability in data collection contexts and the specificity of annotations.\n  In this paper, we introduce ChimpBehave, a novel dataset featuring over 2 hours of video (approximately 193,000 video frames) of zoo-housed chimpanzees, meticulously annotated with bounding boxes and behavior labels for action recognition. ChimpBehave uniquely aligns its behavior classes with existing datasets, allowing for the study of domain adaptation and cross-dataset generalization methods between different visual settings. Furthermore, we benchmark our dataset using a state-of-the-art CNN-based action recognition model, providing the first baseline results for both within and cross-dataset settings.

    "abstract": "Automatic emotion recognition has recently gained significant attention due to the growing popularity of deep learning algorithms. One of the primary challenges in emotion recognition is effectively utilizing the various cues (modalities) available in the data. Another challenge is providing a proper explanation of the outcome of the learning.To address these challenges, we present Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Situational Knowledge (EMERSK), a generalized and modular system for human emotion recognition and explanation using visual information. Our system can handle multiple modalities, including facial expressions, posture, and gait, in a flexible and modular manner. The network consists of different modules that can be added or removed depending on the available data. We utilize a two-stream network architecture with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and encoder-decoder style attention mechanisms to extract deep features from face images. Similarly, CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) are employed to extract features from posture and gait data. We also incorporate deep features from the background as contextual information for the learning process. The deep features from each module are fused using an early fusion network. Furthermore, we leverage situational knowledge derived from the location type and adjective-noun pair (ANP) extracted from the scene, as well as the spatio-temporal average distribution of emotions, to generate explanations. Ablation studies demonstrate that each sub-network can independently perform emotion recognition, and combining them in a multimodal approach significantly improves overall recognition performance. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets, including GroupWalk, validate the superior performance of our approach compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

However, due to insufficient annotated emotion datasets, pre-trained models are limited in their generalization capability and thus lead to poor performance on novel test sets. To mitigate this challenge, transfer learning performing fine-tuning on pre-trained models has been applied. However, the fine-tuned knowledge may overwrite and/or discard important knowledge learned from pre-trained models. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a PathNet-based transfer learning method that is able to transfer emotional knowledge learned from one visual/audio emotion domain to another visual/audio emotion domain, and transfer the emotional knowledge learned from multiple audio emotion domains into one another to improve overall emotion recognition accuracy. To show the robustness of our proposed system, various sets of experiments for facial expression recognition and speech emotion recognition task on three emotion datasets: SAVEE, EMODB, and eNTERFACE have been carried out. The experimental results indicate that our proposed system is capable of improving the performance of emotion recognition, making its performance substantially superior to the recent proposed fine-tuning/pre-trained models based transfer learning methods.",

Standard methodologies that rely solely on the extraction of bodily and facial features often fall short of accurate emotion prediction in cases where the aforementioned sources of affective information are inaccessible due to head/body orientation, low resolution and poor illumination. We aspire to alleviate this problem by leveraging visual context in the form of scene characteristics and attributes, as part of a broader emotion recognition framework. Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) constitute the backbone of our proposed model. Apart from the RGB input modality, we make use of dense Optical Flow, following an intuitive multi-stream approach for a more effective encoding of motion. Furthermore, we shift our attention towards skeleton-based learning and leverage action-centric data as means of pre-training a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) for the task of emotion recognition. Our extensive experiments on the challenging Body Language Dataset (BoLD) verify the superiority of our methods over existing approaches, while by properly incorporating all of the aforementioned modules in a network ensemble, we manage to surpass the previous best published recognition scores, by a large margin.",

These physiological indicators, though rich in data, present challenges due to their complexity and variability, necessitating sophisticated feature selection and extraction methods. NGN, an unsupervised learning algorithm, effectively adapts to input spaces without predefined grid structures, improving feature extraction from physiological data. Furthermore, the incorporation of fuzzy logic enables the handling of fuzzy data by introducing reasoning that mimics human decision-making. The combination of PSO with XGBoost aids in optimizing model performance through efficient hyperparameter tuning and decision process optimization. This study explores the integration of Neural-Gas Network (NGN), XGBoost, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and fuzzy logic to enhance emotion recognition using physiological signals. Our research addresses three critical questions concerning the improvement of XGBoost with PSO and fuzzy logic, NGN's effectiveness in feature selection, and the performance comparison of the PSO-fuzzy XGBoost classifier with standard benchmarks. Acquired results indicate that our methodologies enhance the accuracy of emotion recognition systems and outperform other feature selection techniques using the majority of classifiers, offering significant implications for both theoretical advancement and practical application in emotion recognition technology.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) achieves remarkable performance in various domains such as knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, and semantic understanding. However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion detection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition. The underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the reasons behind ICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a method to address this issue. Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot experiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained emotion recognition. Based on this theory, we uncover the following deficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are semantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. (2) It is prone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Emotion Context Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition. E-ICL relies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by referring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels. Simultaneously, E-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness. Note that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a plug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training. Experiments on the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues, EmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion prediction performance. Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used is lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by over 4% on multiple datasets.",

We implement a quality control pipeline for MELD and IEMOCAP datasets that validates speaker identity, audio-text alignment, and face detection. We leverage transfer learning from speaker and face recognition, assuming that identity-discriminative embeddings capture not only stable acoustic and Facial traits but also person-specific patterns of emotional expression. We employ RecoMadeEasy(R) engines for extracting 512-dimensional speaker and face embeddings, fine-tune MPNet-v2 for emotion-aware text representations, and adapt these features through emotion-specific MLPs trained on unimodal datasets. MAMBA-based trimodal fusion achieves 64.8% accuracy on MELD and 74.3% on IEMOCAP. These results show that combining identity-based audio and visual embeddings with emotion-tuned text representations on a quality-controlled subset of data yields consistent competitive performance for multimodal emotion recognition in conversation and provides a basis for further improvement on challenging, low-frequency emotion classes.",

A significant challenge in online teaching is the absence of real-time feedback from teachers on students learning progress. This paper introduces a novel approach employing deep learning techniques based on facial expressions to assess students engagement levels during online learning sessions. Human emotions cannot be adequately conveyed by a student using only the basic emotions, including anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutrality. To address this challenge, proposed a generation of four complex emotions such as confusion, satisfaction, disappointment, and frustration by combining the basic emotions. These complex emotions are often experienced simultaneously by students during the learning session. To depict these emotions dynamically,utilized a continuous stream of image frames instead of discrete images. The proposed work utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to categorize the fundamental emotional states of learners accurately. The proposed CNN model demonstrates strong performance, achieving a 95% accuracy in precise categorization of learner emotions.",

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition is involved in several real-world applications. With an increase in available modalities, automatic understanding of emotions is being performed more accurately. The success in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER), primarily relies on the supervised learning paradigm. However, data annotation is expensive, time-consuming, and as emotion expression and perception depends on several factors (e.g., age, gender, culture) obtaining labels with a high reliability is hard. Motivated by these, we focus on unsupervised feature learning for MER. We consider discrete emotions, and as modalities text, audio and vision are used. Our method, as being based on contrastive loss between pairwise modalities, is the first attempt in MER literature. Our end-to-end feature learning approach has several differences (and advantages) compared to existing MER methods: i) it is unsupervised, so the learning is lack of data labelling cost; ii) it does not require data spatial augmentation, modality alignment, large number of batch size or epochs; iii) it applies data fusion only at inference; and iv) it does not require backbones pre-trained on emotion recognition task. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms several baseline approaches and unsupervised learning methods applied in MER.

    "title": "Sensing technologies and machine learning methods for emotion recognition in autism: Systematic review",
    "abstract": "Background: Human Emotion Recognition (HER) has been a popular field of study in the past years. Despite the great progresses made so far, relatively little attention has been paid to the use of HER in autism. People with autism are known to face problems with daily social communication and the prototypical interpretation of emotional responses, which are most frequently exerted via facial expressions. This poses significant practical challenges to the application of regular HER systems, which are normally developed for and by neurotypical people. Objective: This study reviews the literature on the use of HER systems in autism, particularly with respect to sensing technologies and machine learning methods, as to identify existing barriers and possible future directions. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles published between January 2011 and June 2023 according to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines. Manuscripts were identified through searching Web of Science and Scopus databases. Manuscripts were included when related to emotion recognition, used sensors and machine learning techniques, and involved children with autism, young, or adults. Results: The search yielded 346 articles. A total of 65 publications met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Conclusions: Studies predominantly used facial expression techniques as the emotion recognition method. Consequently, video cameras were the most widely used devices across studies, although a growing trend in the use of physiological sensors was observed lately. Happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise were most frequently addressed. Classical supervised machine learning techniques were primarily used at the expense of unsupervised approaches or more recent deep learning models.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous datasets for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) are scarce and frequently derived from laboratory environments or staged scenarios, such as TV shows, limiting their application in real-world contexts. We developed and publicly released the Emotional Voice Messages (EMOVOME) dataset, including 999 voice messages from real conversations of 100 Spanish speakers on a messaging app, labeled in continuous and discrete emotions by expert and non-expert annotators. We evaluated speaker-independent SER models using acoustic features as baseline and transformer-based models. We compared the results with reference datasets including acted and elicited speech, and analyzed the influence of annotators and gender fairness. The pre-trained UniSpeech-SAT-Large model achieved the highest results, 61.64% and 55.57% Unweighted Accuracy (UA) for 3-class valence and arousal prediction respectively on EMOVOME, a 10% improvement over baseline models. For the emotion categories, 42.58% UA was obtained. EMOVOME performed lower than the acted RAVDESS dataset. The elicited IEMOCAP dataset also outperformed EMOVOME in predicting emotion categories, while similar results were obtained in valence and arousal. EMOVOME outcomes varied with annotator labels, showing better results and fairness when combining expert and non-expert annotations. This study highlights the gap between controlled and real-life scenarios, supporting further advancements in recognizing genuine emotions.",

    "abstract": "Emotional expressions are the behaviors that communicate our emotional state or attitude to others. They are expressed through verbal and non-verbal communication. Complex human behavior can be understood by studying physical features from multiple modalities; mainly facial, vocal and physical gestures. Recently, spontaneous multi-modal emotion recognition has been extensively studied for human behavior analysis. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based approach for audio-visual emotion recognition. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep learning like knowledge distillation and high-performing deep architectures. The deep feature representations of the audio and visual modalities are fused based on a model-level fusion strategy. A recurrent neural network is then used to capture the temporal dynamics. Our proposed approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in predicting valence on the RECOLA dataset. Moreover, our proposed visual facial expression feature extraction network outperforms state-of-the-art results on the AffectNet and Google Facial Expression Comparison datasets.",

The pervasive influence of technology on daily lives necessitates a deep understanding of its impact on mental health services. This study synthesizes literature covering Behavioral Intervention Technologies (BITs), digital mental health interventions during COVID-19, young men's attitudes toward mental health technologies, technology-based interventions for university students, and the applicability of mobile health technologies for individuals with serious mental illnesses. BITs are recognized for their potential to provide evidence-based interventions for mental health conditions, especially anxiety disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for the adoption of digital mental health services, underscoring their crucial role in providing accessible and quality care; however, their efficacy needs to be reinforced by workforce training, high-quality evidence, and digital equity. A nuanced understanding of young men's attitudes toward mental health is imperative for devising effective online services. Technology-based interventions for university students are promising, although variable in effectiveness; their deployment must be evidence-based and tailored to individual needs. Mobile health technologies, particularly activity tracking, hold promise for individuals with serious mental illnesses. Collectively, technology has immense potential to revolutionize mental health care. However, the implementation must be evidence-based, ethical, and equitable, with continued research focusing on experiences across diverse populations, ensuring accessibility and efficacy for all.",

While early rule-based systems have been around for several years, large language models (LLMs) offer new capabilities in conversational fluency, empathy simulation, and availability. This study explores how users engage with LLMs as mental health tools by analyzing over 10,000 TikTok comments from videos referencing LLMs as mental health tools. Using a self-developed tiered coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy, generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with. While the findings underscore the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices, they also highlight the urgent need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI for mental health support.",

    "abstract": "While the applications and demands of Machine learning (ML) systems in mental health are growing, there is little discussion nor consensus regarding a uniquely challenging aspect: building security methods and requirements into these ML systems, and keep the ML system usable for end-users. This question of usable security is very important, because the lack of consideration in either security or usability would hinder large-scale user adoption and active usage of ML systems in mental health applications.\n  In this short paper, we introduce a framework of four pillars, and a set of desired properties which can be used to systematically guide and evaluate security-related designs, implementations, and deployments of ML systems for mental health. We aim to weave together threads from different domains, incorporate existing views, and propose new principles and requirements, in an effort to lay out a clear framework where criteria and expectations are established, and are used to make security mechanisms usable for end-users of those ML systems in mental health. Together with this framework, we present several concrete scenarios where different usable security cases and profiles in ML-systems in mental health applications are examined and evaluated.",

Based on this work, we have also explored future directions for developing interventions to support financial wellbeing. Furthermore, we have described the technical, ethical, and equity challenges for financial data-driven assessments and intervention methods, as well as provided a broad research agenda to address these challenges.

    "abstract": "The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) offers a unique opportunity to examine the causal relationship between Medicaid coverage and happiness among low-income adults, using an experimental design. This study leverages data from comprehensive surveys conducted at 0 and 12 months post-treatment. Previous studies based on OHIE have shown that individuals receiving Medicaid exhibited a significant improvement in mental health compared to those who did not receive coverage. The primary objective is to explore how Medicaid coverage impacts happiness, specifically analyzing in which direction variations in healthcare spending significantly improve mental health: higher spending or lower spending after Medicaid. Utilizing instrumental variable (IV) regression, I conducted six separate regressions across subgroups categorized by expenditure levels and happiness ratings, and the results reveal distinct patterns. Enrolling in OHP has significantly decreased the probability of experiencing unhappiness, regardless of whether individuals had high or low medical spending. Additionally, it decreased the probability of being pretty happy and having high medical expenses, while increasing the probability among those with lower expenses. Concerning the probability of being very happy, the OHP only had a positive effect on being very happy and spending less, and its effect on those with high expenses was insignificant. These findings align with the benefit of Medicaid: alleviating financial burden, contributing to the well-being of distinct subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Addressing the critical shortage of mental health resources for effective screening, diagnosis, and treatment remains a significant challenge. This scarcity underscores the need for innovative solutions, particularly in enhancing the accessibility and efficacy of therapeutic support. Embodied agents with advanced interactive capabilities emerge as a promising and cost-effective supplement to traditional caregiving methods. Crucial to these agents' effectiveness is their ability to simulate non-verbal behaviors, like backchannels, that are pivotal in establishing rapport and understanding in therapeutic contexts but remain under-explored. To improve the rapport-building capabilities of embodied agents we annotated backchannel smiles in videos of intimate face-to-face conversations over topics such as mental health, illness, and relationships. We hypothesized that both speaker and listener behaviors affect the duration and intensity of backchannel smiles. Using cues from speech prosody and language along with the demographics of the speaker and listener, we found them to contain significant predictors of the intensity of backchannel smiles. Based on our findings, we introduce backchannel smile production in embodied agents as a generation problem. Our attention-based generative model suggests that listener information offers performance improvements over the baseline speaker-centric generation approach. Conditioned generation using the significant predictors of smile intensity provides statistically significant improvements in empirical measures of generation quality. Our user study by transferring generated smiles to an embodied agent suggests that agent with backchannel smiles is perceived to be more human-like and is an attractive alternative for non-personal conversations over agent without backchannel smiles.",

    "abstract": "Global rates of mental health concerns are rising, and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental health care will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health related tasks. In this paper, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs' application to mental health and encourage the adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. It is especially critical to ensure that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, and adhere to ethical standards and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally.",

    "abstract": "The chapter discusses the foundational impact of modern generative AI models on information access (IA) systems. In contrast to traditional AI, the large-scale training and superior data modeling of generative AI models enable them to produce high-quality, human-like responses, which brings brand new opportunities for the development of IA paradigms. In this chapter, we identify and introduce two of them in details, i.e., information generation and information synthesis. Information generation allows AI to create tailored content addressing user needs directly, enhancing user experience with immediate, relevant outputs. Information synthesis leverages the ability of generative AI to integrate and reorganize existing information, providing grounded responses and mitigating issues like model hallucination, which is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring precision and external knowledge. This chapter delves into the foundational aspects of generative models, including architecture, scaling, and training, and discusses their applications in multi-modal scenarios. Additionally, it examines the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm and other methods for corpus modeling and understanding, demonstrating how generative AI can enhance information access systems. It also summarizes potential challenges and fruitful directions for future studies.",

    "abstract": "We propose a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for mental health diagnosis that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and constraint logic programming (CLP). Having a CDSS is important because of the high complexity of diagnostic manuals used by mental health professionals and the danger of diagnostic errors. Our CDSS is a software tool that uses an LLM to translate diagnostic manuals to a logic program and solves the program using an off-the-shelf CLP engine to query a patient's diagnosis based on the encoded rules and provided data. By giving domain experts the opportunity to inspect the LLM-generated logic program, and making modifications when needed, our CDSS ensures that the diagnosis is not only accurate but also interpretable. We experimentally compare it with two baseline approaches of using LLMs: diagnosing patients using the LLM-only approach, and using the LLM-generated logic program but without expert inspection. The results show that, while LLMs are extremely useful in generating candidate logic programs, these programs still require expert inspection and modification to guarantee faithfulness to the official diagnostic manuals. Additionally, ethical concerns arise from the direct use of patient data in LLMs, underscoring the need for a safer hybrid approach like our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Mental health issues among college students have reached critical levels, significantly impacting academic performance and overall wellbeing. Predicting and understanding mental health status among college students is challenging due to three main factors: the necessity for large-scale longitudinal datasets, the prevalence of black-box machine learning models lacking transparency, and the tendency of existing approaches to provide aggregated insights at the population level rather than individualized understanding.\n  To tackle these challenges, this paper presents I-HOPE, the first Interpretable Hierarchical mOdel for Personalized mEntal health prediction. I-HOPE is a two-stage hierarchical model that connects raw behavioral features to mental health status through five defined behavioral categories as interaction labels. We evaluate I-HOPE on the College Experience Study, the longest longitudinal mobile sensing dataset. This dataset spans five years and captures data from both pre-pandemic periods and the COVID-19 pandemic. I-HOPE achieves a prediction accuracy of 91%, significantly surpassing the 60-70% accuracy of baseline methods. In addition, I-HOPE distills complex patterns into interpretable and individualized insights, enabling the future development of tailored interventions and improving mental health support. The code is available at https://github.com/roycmeghna/I-HOPE.",

    "abstract": "Automatically generating short summaries from users' online mental health posts could save counselors' reading time and reduce their fatigue so that they can provide timely responses to those seeking help for improving their mental state. Recent Transformers-based summarization models have presented a promising approach to abstractive summarization. They go beyond sentence selection and extractive strategies to deal with more complicated tasks such as novel word generation and sentence paraphrasing. Nonetheless, these models have a prominent shortcoming; their training strategy is not quite efficient, which restricts the model's performance. In this paper, we include a curriculum learning approach to reweigh the training samples, bringing about an efficient learning procedure. We apply our model on extreme summarization dataset of MentSum posts -- a dataset of mental health related posts from Reddit social media. Compared to the state-of-the-art model, our proposed method makes substantial gains in terms of Rouge and Bertscore evaluation metrics, yielding 3.5% (Rouge-1), 10.4% (Rouge-2), and 4.7% (Rouge-L), 1.5% (Bertscore) relative improvements.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) give the UN a road map for development with Agenda 2030 as a target. SDG3 \"Good Health and Well-Being\" ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all ages. Digital technologies can support SDG3. Burnout and even depression could be reduced by encouraging better preventive health. Due to the lack of patient knowledge and focus to take care of their health, it is necessary to help patients before it is too late. New trends such as positive psychology and mindfulness are highly encouraged in the USA. Digital Twins (DTs) can help with the continuous monitoring of emotion using physiological signals (e.g., collected via wearables). DTs facilitate monitoring and provide constant health insight to improve quality of life and well-being with better personalization. Healthcare DTs challenges are standardizing data formats, communication protocols, and data exchange mechanisms. As an example, ISO has the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41 Internet of Things (IoT) and DTs Working Group, with standards such as \"ISO/IEC 21823-3:2021 IoT - Interoperability for IoT Systems - Part 3 Semantic interoperability\", \"ISO/IEC CD 30178 - IoT - Data format, value and coding\". To achieve those data integration and knowledge challenges, we designed the Mental Health Knowledge Graph (ontology and dataset) to boost mental health. As an example, explicit knowledge is described such as chocolate contains magnesium which is recommended for depression. The Knowledge Graph (KG) acquires knowledge from ontology-based mental health projects classified within the LOV4IoT ontology catalog (Emotion, Depression, and Mental Health). Furthermore, the KG is mapped to standards when possible. Standards from ETSI SmartM2M can be used such as SAREF4EHAW to represent medical devices and sensors, but also ITU/WHO, ISO, W3C, NIST, and IEEE standards relevant to mental health can be considered.",

Exploring such sensitive topics through online search has been an essential part of adolescent development, and CAs can support their knowledge discovery on such topics through human-like dialogues. Yet, unintended risks have been documented with adolescents' interactions with AI-based CAs, such as being exposed to inappropriate content, false information, and/or being given advice that is detrimental to their mental and physical well-being (e.g., to self-harm). In this position paper, we discuss the current landscape and opportunities for CAs to support adolescents' mental and sexual health knowledge discovery. We also discuss some of the challenges related to ensuring the safety of adolescents when interacting with CAs regarding sexual and mental health topics. We call for a discourse on how to set guardrails for the safe evolution of AI-based CAs for adolescents.",

With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in, and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental health service provision.",

    "title": "When Testing AI Tests Us: Safeguarding Mental Health on the Digital Frontlines",
    "abstract": "Red-teaming is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized -- one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers is a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines.",

The approach relies on using the Adjoinable MPI library to reverse the non-blocking communication patterns in the original code, and by controlling the memory overhead induced by the time-stepping loop with binomial checkpointing.

When the dataset is a finite sample of a line bundle, we implement an effective algorithm to compute its persistent Stiefel-Whitney classes. In order to use simplicial approximation techniques in practice, we develop a notion of weak simplicial approximation.

Also covered is the case where the quasi-static assumption in solid mechanics is violated. The computational tool is demonstrated to capture all of these behaviors in an accurate and robust manner, with significant savings in time.

In the specific setting of multidimensional persistent homology we show that the problem is at least as hard as a matrix invertibility problem. Furthermore, this allows us to conclude that the interleaving distance of interval decomposable modules depends on the characteristic of the field. Persistence modules valued in the category of sets are also studied. As a corollary, we obtain that the isomorphism problem for Reeb graphs is graph isomorphism complete.",

We present a procedure that computes, in (dn)^O(k) arithmetic operations in D, a set S of (real univariate representations of) sampling points in K^n that intersects nontrivially each connected component of Z. As soon as k=o(n), this is faster than the standard methods that all have exponential dependence on n in the complexity. In particular, our procedure is polynomial-time for constant k. In contrast, the best previously known procedure (due to A.Barvinok) is only capable of deciding in n^O(k^2) operations the nonemptiness (rather than constructing sampling points) of the set Z in the case of p(Y)=sum_i Y_i^2 and homogeneous Q.\n  A by-product of our procedure is a bound (dn)^O(k) on the number of connected components of Z.\n  The procedure consists of exact symbolic computations in D and outputs vectors of algebraic numbers.

The goals of the summit were to discuss algorithmic and software alterations required for successfully porting respective code bases to exascale-class computing hardware, compare software engineering techniques used by various code teams, and consider the adoption of industry-standard benchmark problems to better facilitate code-to-code performance comparisons. A large portion of the meeting included candid discussions of direct experiences with approaches that have and have not worked. Participants reported that identifying and implementing suitable Monte Carlo algorithms for GPUs continues to be a sticking point. They also report significant difficulty porting existing algorithms between GPU APIs (specifically Nvidia CUDA to AMD ROCm). To better compare code-to-code performance, participants decided to design a C5G7-like benchmark problem with a defined figure of merit, with the expectation of adding more benchmarks in the future. Problem specifications and results will eventually be hosted in a public repository and will be open to submissions by all Monte Carlo transport codes capable of running the benchmark problem. The participants also identified the need to explore the intermediate and long-term future of the Monte Carlo neutron transport community and how best to modernize and contextualize Monte Carlo as a useful tool in modern industry. Overall the summit was considered to be a success by the organizers and participants, and the group shared a strong desire for future, potentially larger, Monte Carlo summits.",

This procedure is stable (at least to certain types of perturbations of the input). This justifies the use of the diagram as a signature of the input, and the use of features derived from it in statistics and machine learning. However, these computations also produce other information of great interest to practitioners that is unfortunately unstable. For example, each point in the diagram corresponds to a simplex whose addition in the filtration results in the birth of the corresponding persistent homology class, but this correspondence is unstable. In addition, the persistence diagram is not stable with respect to other procedures that are employed in practice, such as thresholding a point cloud by density. We recast these problems as real-valued functions which are discontinuous but measurable, and then observe that convolving such a function with a suitable function produces a Lipschitz function. The resulting stable function can be estimated by perturbing the input and averaging the output. We illustrate this approach with a number of examples, including a stable localization of a persistent homology generator from brain imaging data.",

    "title": "Computational topology and the Unique Games Conjecture",
    "abstract": "Covering spaces of graphs have long been useful for studying expanders (as \"graph lifts\") and unique games (as the \"label-extended graph\"). In this paper we advocate for the thesis that there is a much deeper relationship between computational topology and the Unique Games Conjecture. Our starting point is Linial's 2005 observation that the only known problems whose inapproximability is equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture - Unique Games and Max-2Lin - are instances of Maximum Section of a Covering Space on graphs. We then observe that the reduction between these two problems (Khot-Kindler-Mossel-O'Donnell, FOCS 2004; SICOMP, 2007) gives a well-defined map of covering spaces. We further prove that inapproximability for Maximum Section of a Covering Space on (cell decompositions of) closed 2-manifolds is also equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture. This gives the first new \"Unique Games-complete\" problem in over a decade.\n  Our results partially settle an open question of Chen and Freedman (SODA 2010; Disc. Comput. Geom., 2011) from computational topology, by showing that their question is almost equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture. (The main difference is that they ask for inapproximability over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and we show Unique Games-completeness over $\\mathbb{Z}/k\\mathbb{Z}$ for large $k$.) This equivalence comes from the fact that when the structure group $G$ of the covering space is Abelian - or more generally for principal $G$-bundles - Maximum Section of a $G$-Covering Space is the same as the well-studied problem of 1-Homology Localization.\n  Although our most technically demanding result is an application of Unique Games to computational topology, we hope that our observations on the topological nature of the Unique Games Conjecture will lead to applications of algebraic topology to the Unique Games Conjecture in the future.",

    "title": "Propositional computability logic I",
    "abstract": "In the same sense as classical logic is a formal theory of truth, the recently initiated approach called computability logic is a formal theory of computability. It understands (interactive) computational problems as games played by a machine against the environment, their computability as existence of a machine that always wins the game, logical operators as operations on computational problems, and validity of a logical formula as being a scheme of \"always computable\" problems. The present contribution gives a detailed exposition of a soundness and completeness proof for an axiomatization of one of the most basic fragments of computability logic. The logical vocabulary of this fragment contains operators for the so called parallel and choice operations, and its atoms represent elementary problems, i.e. predicates in the standard sense. This article is self-contained as it explains all relevant concepts. While not technically necessary, however, familiarity with the foundational paper \"Introduction to computability logic\" [Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 123 (2003), pp.1-99] would greatly help the reader in understanding the philosophy, underlying motivations, potential and utility of computability logic, -- the context that determines the value of the present results.

    "abstract": "Semiconductor devices are scaled down to the level which constituent materials are no longer considered continuous. To account for atomistic randomness, surface effects and quantum mechanical effects, an atomistic modeling approach needs to be pursued. The Nanoelectronic Modeling Tool (NEMO 3-D) has satisfied the requirement by including emprical $sp^{3}s^{*}$ and $sp^{3}d^{5}s^{*}$ tight binding models and considering strain to successfully simulate various semiconductor material systems. Computationally, however, NEMO 3-D needs significant improvements to utilize increasing supply of processors. This paper introduces the new modeling tool, OMEN 3-D, and discusses the major computational improvements, the 3-D domain decomposition and the multi-level parallelism. As a featured application, a full 3-D parallelized Schrödinger-Poisson solver and its application to calculate the bandstructure of $δ$ doped phosphorus(P) layer in silicon is demonstrated. Impurity bands due to the donor ion potentials are computed.",

Since VR and AR could provide more immersive experimental environments and stimuli than 2D settings in a cost-efficient way, psychological and cognitive researchers are particularly interested in using these platforms. However, there is still an entry barrier for researchers who are not familiar with Unity programming, and current VR/AR HMDs could also cause unexpected errors during the experiment. Therefore, we developed a Unity library that can be adopted in various experiments universally and assist researchers in developing their own. Our library provides functions related to trial assignment and results saving. That way, researchers can easily implement the essential functions of their psychological experiments. We also made a function that enables proceeding with the experiment from a specific trial point to handle unexpected errors caused by HMD tracking loss issues during the experiment. We expect our library could invite researchers from various disciplines and help them acquire valuable insights in VR/AR environments.",

    "abstract": "Mollusk shells are an ideal model system for understanding the morpho-elastic basis of morphological evolution of invertebrates' exoskeletons. During the formation of the shell, the mantle tissue secretes proteins and minerals that calcify to form a new incremental layer of the exoskeleton. Most of the existing literature on the morphology of mollusks is descriptive. The mathematical understanding of the underlying coupling between pre-existing shell morphology, de novo surface deposition and morpho-elastic volume growth is at a nascent stage, primarily limited to reduced geometric representations. Here, we propose a general, three-dimensional computational framework coupling pre-existing morphology, incremental surface growth by accretion, and morpho-elastic volume growth. We exercise this framework by applying it to explain the stepwise morphogenesis of seashells during growth: new material surfaces are laid down by accretive growth on the mantle whose form is determined by its morpho-elastic growth. Calcification of the newest surfaces extends the shell as well as creates a new scaffold that constrains the next growth step. We study the effects of surface and volumetric growth rates, and of previously deposited shell geometries on the resulting modes of mantle deformation, and therefore of the developing shell's morphology. Connections are made to a range of complex shells ornamentations.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, several successful applications of the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have emerged in nuclear physics and high-energy physics, as well as in biology, chemistry, meteorology, and other fields of science. A major goal of nuclear theory is to predict nuclear structure and nuclear reactions from the underlying theory of the strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). With access to powerful High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, several ab initio approaches, such as the No-Core Shell Model (NCSM), have been developed to calculate the properties of atomic nuclei. However, to accurately solve for the properties of atomic nuclei, one faces immense theoretical and computational challenges. The present study proposes a feed-forward ANN method for predicting the properties of atomic nuclei like ground state energy and ground state point proton root-mean-square (rms) radius based on NCSM results in computationally accessible basis spaces. The designed ANNs are sufficient to produce results for these two very different observables in 6Li from the ab initio NCSM results in small basis spaces that satisfy the theoretical physics condition: independence of basis space parameters in the limit of extremely large matrices. We also provide comparisons of the results from ANNs with established methods of estimating the results in the infinite matrix limit.",

    "abstract": "Biological regulatory networks depend upon chemical interactions to process information. Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output. Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and composable ($f\\circ g$ can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$ and $g$). Rate independence and composability are important engineering desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or even \"well-mixedness\", and allowing the systematic construction of complex computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus composability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more sophisticated input/output encodings are used.",
